        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 7: The Biggest Gamble in History</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part II: Nehru's India (1950-1964)</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>In 1951-52, India held the world's first elections under universal adult franchise for a population this size. With 173 million eligible voters—85% illiterate—and 53 recognized parties, the election was the greatest experiment in democratic history. This chapter describes how India proved the skeptics wrong.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>When India announced it would hold elections with universal adult suffrage, Western observers were incredulous. How could a country with 85% illiteracy, hundreds of languages, and deep caste and religious divisions possibly conduct a democratic election?</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "A blind, vicious and immoral democracy cannot be trusted to preserve the national interest."
                <cite>— Conservative critics, 1951</cite>
            </div>

            <p>Some suggested limiting the franchise to the educated or property owners. Others proposed a "basic democracy" where only local councils would be directly elected. Nehru rejected all such proposals. India would be a democracy of all its citizens or not at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Logistical Challenge</h2>
            <p>The Election Commission, under Sukumar Sen, faced enormous practical problems. How do you create electoral rolls in a country where most people don't have written names? How do you enable illiterate voters to mark their choice? How do you reach remote villages?</p>

                <h4>Innovations for Illiterate Voters</h4>
                <p>The Commission developed a system of party symbols—a pair of bullocks for Congress, a lamp for the Socialists, an elephant for various parties. Voters could mark their choice by recognizing the symbol, not reading the name. This system continues today.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Parties and Candidates</h2>
            <p>The Indian National Congress, led by Nehru, was the dominant force—the party of independence. But it faced competition from multiple directions.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>The Electoral Landscape</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Indian National Congress:</strong> Nehru's party, secular nationalist</li>
                    <li><strong>Socialists:</strong> Congress breakaways demanding more radical reform</li>
                    <li><strong>Communist Party:</strong> Strong in some states, advocating revolution</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan Sangh:</strong> Hindu nationalist, ancestor of today's BJP</li>
                    <li><strong>Hindu Mahasabha:</strong> Hindu revivalist, weakened after Gandhi's assassination</li>
                    <li><strong>Regional parties:</strong> Demanding linguistic states and local autonomy</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Campaign</h2>
            <p>Nehru campaigned tirelessly, traveling 25,000 miles and addressing an estimated 35 million people. His message combined national unity, democratic socialism, and secularism. He was by far the most popular figure in the country.</p>

            <div class="historical-event">
                <h4>Nehru's Appeal</h4>
                <p>For millions of Indians, especially women, this was their first vote. Many came to see Nehru as much as to vote. He represented independence, modernity, and hope. His personal popularity far exceeded his party's.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Voting</h2>
            <p>Elections were held over four months (October 1951 to February 1952) due to logistical constraints. Despite predictions of chaos, the voting proceeded remarkably smoothly. Women voted in large numbers, often for the first time in their lives.</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "The elections have constituted a remarkable demonstration of the vitality of the democratic system in what many Westerners would regard as unpromising soil."
                <cite>— The Manchester Guardian, 1952</cite>
            </div>

            <p>Some areas did face problems—booth capturing, intimidation, and irregularities—but overall, the process was far more orderly than critics had predicted.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Results</h2>
            <p>Congress won decisively—364 of 489 seats in the Lok Sabha with 45% of the vote. The Communists came second with 16 seats. The Socialists won 12. The Hindu nationalists were marginalized.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The first-past-the-post system magnified Congress's plurality into an overwhelming majority. This would be the pattern for decades—Congress dominant but never truly majority.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Significance</h2>
            <p>The 1951-52 elections established India as a functioning democracy. They proved that poor, illiterate populations could participate meaningfully in democratic governance. They legitimized the new state and provided a peaceful mechanism for change.</p>

            <div class="milestone-box">
                <h4>A Democratic Foundation</h4>
                <p>Guha calls this election "the biggest gamble in history"—and India won. The success of the first elections established a precedent. Democracy was not a gift from the elite but a right exercised by the people. Every subsequent election built on this foundation.</p>
