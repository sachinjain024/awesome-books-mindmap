        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 24: Democracy and Discord</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part IV: A Fourth Revolution (1977-1991)</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Indira Gandhi's final term (1980-1984) was marked by the Punjab crisis, Operation Blue Star, and her assassination. This chapter tells the tragic story of how militancy in Punjab led to the storming of the Golden Temple and its fatal consequences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Return</h2>
            <p>Indira Gandhi returned to power in January 1980, winning 353 seats. But the Congress she led was weaker than before—dependent entirely on her, with hollowed-out state organizations and sycophantic leaders.</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "Indira returned to power humbled by defeat and mellowed by time. But she still could not tolerate dissent or delegate authority."
                <cite>— Ramachandra Guha</cite>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Sanjay's Death</h2>
            <p>In June 1980, Sanjay Gandhi died in a plane crash while performing aerobatic stunts. His death devastated Indira. Her surviving son, Rajiv—a reluctant politician—was pressured into politics to fill the void.</p>

            <div class="key-figure">
                <h4>Rajiv Gandhi Enters Politics</h4>
                <p>Rajiv, an airline pilot, had avoided politics. But after Sanjay's death, family pressure and his mother's needs drew him in. Within months, he won his brother's parliamentary seat. The dynastic succession continued.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Punjab Crisis</h2>
            <p>The roots of Punjab's crisis lay in long-standing Akali demands: more autonomy, Chandigarh, river waters, and religious issues. Indira, rather than negotiating seriously, encouraged Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale—a religious extremist—to split the Akalis.</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>Bhindranwale's Rise</h4>
                <p>Bhindranwale was initially promoted by Congress to undermine the Akalis. But he escaped control, turned violent, and eventually fortified himself in the Golden Temple complex—Sikhism's holiest shrine. Assassinations of Hindus and moderate Sikhs escalated.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Operation Blue Star</h2>
            <p>In June 1984, the Indian Army stormed the Golden Temple to flush out Bhindranwale and his armed followers. The operation succeeded militarily but was a political and religious catastrophe.</p>

            <div class="historical-event">
                <h4>The Assault</h4>
                <p>Fighting lasted three days. The army used tanks. The Akal Takht—the second-holiest Sikh shrine—was heavily damaged. Bhindranwale was killed. But so were hundreds of pilgrims and soldiers. The Sikh community was deeply traumatized.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
            <p>Operation Blue Star alienated even moderate Sikhs. Many saw it as an attack on their faith. Sikh soldiers mutinied. The demand for "Khalistan"—a separate Sikh state—gained support. Indira knew she was a target.</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "I am not interested in a long life. If I die today, every drop of my blood will invigorate the nation."
                <cite>— Indira Gandhi, October 30, 1984</cite>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Assassination</h2>
            <p>On October 31, 1984, Indira Gandhi's own Sikh bodyguards assassinated her. Beant Singh and Satwant Singh shot her as she walked in her garden. She was 66 years old and had dominated Indian politics for nearly two decades.</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>The Murder</h4>
                <p>Despite warnings that her Sikh guards might pose a risk, Indira refused to remove them, saying it would signal distrust of the Sikh community. Her assassins shot her at close range. She died within hours.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The 1984 Riots</h2>
            <p>Indira's assassination triggered anti-Sikh pogroms across North India, especially in Delhi. For three days, mobs—some reportedly led by Congress politicians—massacred Sikhs. The police stood by. Over 3,000 Sikhs were killed.</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>Organized Violence</h4>
                <p>The riots were not spontaneous. Voter lists were used to identify Sikh homes. Attackers arrived in trucks with weapons. The pattern suggested organization. Senior Congress leaders were implicated but never convicted.</p>
