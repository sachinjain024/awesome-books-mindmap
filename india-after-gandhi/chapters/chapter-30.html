        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 30: The Burden of Democracy</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part V: A History of Events (1991-2007)</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>This concluding chapter assesses India's democratic journey—its achievements, failures, and continuing challenges. How has the world's largest democracy performed? What threats does it face? And what does the future hold?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Achievement</h2>
            <p>Against all odds, India has survived as a democracy for over seven decades. Elections are held regularly. Governments change peacefully. Civil liberties, though imperfect, are protected. This is remarkable for a country of India's diversity and poverty.</p>

            <div class="milestone-box">
                <h4>What India Has Achieved</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regular free and fair elections since 1952</li>
                    <li>Peaceful transfers of power between parties</li>
                    <li>A free press (with limitations)</li>
                    <li>An independent judiciary (mostly)</li>
                    <li>Expansion of political participation to all groups</li>
                    <li>Survival as a united nation despite diversity</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Failures</h2>
            <p>Democracy has not solved India's fundamental problems. Poverty persists. Inequality grows. Communal violence recurs. Caste discrimination continues. Corruption is endemic. The state often fails its citizens.</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>Persistent Problems</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>300+ million still live in poverty</li>
                    <li>Public education and health are inadequate</li>
                    <li>Women face violence and discrimination</li>
                    <li>Dalits and tribals remain marginalized</li>
                    <li>Environmental degradation accelerates</li>
                    <li>Governance is often corrupt and inefficient</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Threats to Democracy</h2>
            <p>Indian democracy faces continuing challenges. Religious nationalism threatens secularism. Money power distorts elections. Dynastic politics undermines merit. Institutions are weakened by political interference.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>Warning Signs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Majoritarianism:</strong> The majority community's power may overwhelm minority rights</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutional decay:</strong> Courts, bureaucracy, and election bodies face political pressure</li>
                    <li><strong>Media capture:</strong> Corporate and political control undermines press freedom</li>
                    <li><strong>Criminalization:</strong> Politicians with criminal records enter legislatures</li>
                    <li><strong>Centralization:</strong> Federal balance tilts toward the Centre</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Economic Transformation</h2>
            <p>Since 1991, India has transformed economically. Growth accelerated. A middle class emerged. Global companies invested. Technology created new opportunities. Yet growth has been uneven, benefiting some regions and groups more than others.</p>

            <div class="stats-box">
                <div class="stat-item">
                    <div class="stat-number">7%+</div>
                    <div class="stat-label">Average Growth (2000s)</div>
                </div>

                </div>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Two Indias</h2>
            <p>India is increasingly divided between those who have benefited from growth and those left behind. Urban professionals and rural laborers, tech workers and marginal farmers, English speakers and Hindi speakers—these Indias coexist uneasily.</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "India lives in several centuries simultaneously. The challenge is to bring all Indians into the twenty-first century while respecting their diverse paths."
                <cite>— Ramachandra Guha</cite>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Comparative Perspective</h2>
            <p>Compared to other post-colonial nations, India has done reasonably well. Unlike Pakistan, it avoided military rule. Unlike China, it preserved political freedom. Unlike many African states, it maintained territorial integrity. Democracy, for all its flaws, has worked.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>Why India Succeeded</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Constitutional framework established at independence</li>
                    <li>Strong institutions in the early decades</li>
                    <li>Diverse power centers preventing any one group from dominating</li>
                    <li>Free press maintaining accountability</li>
                    <li>Regular elections creating legitimacy</li>
                    <li>Federal structure accommodating regional aspirations</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>India's democratic future is not guaranteed. Each generation must recommit to constitutional values. The challenges are immense: poverty, inequality, communalism, environmental crisis. But the framework exists. The habits of democracy are established. The outcome depends on choices Indians make.</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "The Indian experiment is a work in progress. It has had many setbacks, but it has not failed. The task of the present generation is to build on what has been achieved while addressing what has been neglected."
                <cite>— Ramachandra Guha</cite>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Guha's Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Ramachandra Guha ends his history with cautious optimism. India is neither a success story nor a failure—it is an ongoing experiment, the world's most ambitious attempt at democratic nation-building. The jury remains out.</p>

            <div class="milestone-box">
                <h4>An Unfinished Story</h4>
                <p>India after Gandhi is the history of an idea: that a vast, diverse, poor nation could govern itself democratically. That idea has survived famines, wars, assassinations, and emergencies. Whether it will triumph remains for future generations to determine.</p>
