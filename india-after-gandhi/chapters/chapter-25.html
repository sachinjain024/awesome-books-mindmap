        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 25: The Rise of the South</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part IV: A Fourth Revolution (1977-1991)</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>By the 1980s, South India had charted its own political path. This chapter examines the rise of regional parties in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka—parties that would eventually become national power brokers in the era of coalition governments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Southern Difference</h2>
            <p>South India developed differently from the Hindi-speaking north. Higher literacy, stronger social reform traditions, and different caste dynamics created a distinctive political culture. The Congress's decline opened space for regional alternatives.</p>

            <div class="geographic-context">
                <h4>Southern Distinctiveness</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher literacy rates and education levels</li>
                    <li>More effective land reforms</li>
                    <li>Stronger anti-caste movements</li>
                    <li>Non-Hindi languages as markers of identity</li>
                    <li>Better health and demographic indicators</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Tamil Nadu: DMK and AIADMK</h2>
            <p>Tamil Nadu had been Congress-free since 1967. The DMK and its breakaway AIADMK alternated in power. Both were Dravidian parties—secular, populist, and focused on Tamil identity—but built around charismatic leaders.</p>

            <div class="key-figure">
                <h4>M.G. Ramachandran (MGR)</h4>
                <p>MGR, a film star who founded AIADMK, was Chief Minister from 1977 until his death in 1987. His image as a champion of the poor—cultivated through hundreds of films—translated into extraordinary political popularity. His death triggered mass mourning and succession battles.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Andhra Pradesh: NTR's Revolution</h2>
            <p>In 1983, N.T. Rama Rao—another film star—founded the Telugu Desam Party and swept to power in Andhra Pradesh. He defeated a Congress government that seemed invincible, proving regional parties could win against the national juggernaut.</p>

            <div class="historical-event">
                <h4>The TDP Wave</h4>
                <p>NTR campaigned on Telugu pride and against Congress corruption. His theatrical style—wearing saffron robes, invoking mythological characters he'd played—connected with voters. The Congress lost Andhra Pradesh, a state it had considered safe.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Karnataka: The Janata Base</h2>
            <p>In Karnataka, the Janata Party and its successors built a strong base. Ramakrishna Hegde's government (1983-88) was seen as relatively clean and efficient. Karnataka became a laboratory for decentralization through panchayati raj.</p>

            <div class="milestone-box">
                <h4>Decentralization Experiment</h4>
                <p>Karnataka's panchayati raj gave real powers to village councils. It was a model for the 73rd Amendment that later mandated panchayats nationwide. The South demonstrated alternatives to the centralized Congress model.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Kerala: Communist Continuity</h2>
            <p>Kerala maintained its distinctive pattern—the Communist-led LDF alternating with Congress-led UDF. The state's high social indicators (literacy, health, life expectancy) contrasted with its economic struggles. The "Kerala model" attracted both praise and criticism.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>The Kerala Paradox</h4>
                <p>Kerala had India's best social indicators but high unemployment and low industrial growth. Educated Keralites migrated to the Gulf for work. Remittances sustained the economy. The model worked for human development, less so for economic growth.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Regional Parties and National Power</h2>
            <p>As Congress declined and no single party could win majorities, regional parties became essential coalition partners. What happened in Tamil Nadu or Andhra Pradesh could determine who governed in Delhi.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>Kingmakers</h4>
                <p>By the 1990s, regional parties held the balance of power nationally. The DMK or AIADMK's choice of alliance partner could make or break national governments. Regional leaders demanded—and got—influence over national policy.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Economic Shift</h2>
            <p>South Indian states increasingly outperformed the north economically. Bangalore emerged as a technology hub. Chennai attracted auto manufacturing. Hyderabad developed IT and pharma industries. The economic center of gravity shifted southward.</p>
