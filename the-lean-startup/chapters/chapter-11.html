        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 11: Adapt</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Three: Accelerate</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>As startups grow, they need to build adaptive organizations that can evolve as conditions change. This chapter introduces the Five Whys technique for root cause analysis and explains how to build a culture that learns from problems rather than assigns blame.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Building an Adaptive Organization</h2>
            <p>Speed matters in a startup, but speed without quality leads to chaos. The challenge is moving fast while still learning from mistakes. Adaptive organizations do both.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>The goal is not to prevent all problems—that's impossible in an uncertain environment. The goal is to build an organization that can detect problems quickly, understand their root causes, and prevent them from recurring.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Five Whys</h2>
            <p>The Five Whys is a technique borrowed from Toyota's production system. When a problem occurs, you ask "why" five times to get to the root cause.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Example: The Five Whys in Action</h4>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A new feature broke the website.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Why?</strong> A server crashed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why?</strong> The server ran out of memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why?</strong> The new feature had a memory leak.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why?</strong> The developer didn't know how to test for memory leaks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why?</strong> We haven't trained new developers on performance testing.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Root cause:</strong> Training gap, not just a code bug.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Notice how the Five Whys moves from a technical symptom to a human/process issue. Most problems have human causes at the root—lack of training, unclear processes, poor communication.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Proportional Investment</h2>
            <p>A key principle of the Five Whys is making a proportional investment at each level. Small problems get small fixes; big problems get bigger investments.</p>

            <div class="framework-box">
                <h4>Proportional Investment Principle</h4>
                <p>If a problem is small (first occurrence, minor impact), make a small fix. If it's recurring or serious, invest more in a systemic solution. This prevents both under-reacting (ignoring problems) and over-reacting (building elaborate systems for one-time issues).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-steps">
                <h4>Applying Proportional Investment</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>First occurrence: Quick fix, note the issue</li>
                    <li>Second occurrence: Investigate the root cause</li>
                    <li>Third occurrence: Systemic fix (training, process, tooling)</li>
                    <li>Chronic issues: Major investment in prevention</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Getting Started with Five Whys</h2>
            <p>Implementing Five Whys requires care. Done wrong, it becomes a blame exercise that destroys trust.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Five Blames Anti-Pattern</h4>
                <p>If Five Whys turns into "who did this?" instead of "what caused this?", people will hide problems instead of surfacing them. The goal is learning, not punishment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="framework-box">
                <h4>Rules for Effective Five Whys</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Be tolerant of mistakes the first time:</strong> Everyone makes errors; focus on prevention</li>
                    <li><strong>Never allow the same mistake to be made twice:</strong> Invest in systemic fixes</li>
                    <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Begin with less controversial problems to build trust</li>
                    <li><strong>Appoint a Five Whys master:</strong> Someone to facilitate and keep the process on track</li>
                    <li><strong>Face the facts:</strong> Accept uncomfortable truths about processes and systems</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The IMVU Training Budget</h2>
            <p>Ries shares how IMVU used Five Whys to create an "automatic" training program.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Case Study: IMVU's Training System</h4>
                <p>At <span class="company">IMVU</span>, when Five Whys revealed that a problem was caused by a training gap, the fix wasn't just training the person who made the mistake. They identified who else might make the same mistake and trained them too.</p>
                <p>Over time, this created a comprehensive training program driven by actual problems rather than theoretical curricula. New engineers got trained on the things that actually caused issues.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Dealing with the Five Whys Curse</h2>
            <p>Sometimes Five Whys can feel overwhelming—every problem reveals more problems. This is the "Five Whys curse."</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>The abundance of problems revealed by Five Whys is actually good news—it means you're uncovering issues that were always there. Better to know about them than to operate in ignorance.</p>
            </div>

            <p>To manage the curse:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prioritize: Not every root cause needs immediate action</li>
                <li>Time-box: Limit Five Whys sessions to prevent endless analysis</li>
                <li>Start simple: Pick smaller problems at first</li>
                <li>Track improvements: Measure whether problems actually decrease over time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Adaptive organizations learn from problems instead of just fixing symptoms</li>
                <li>The Five Whys technique gets to root causes by asking "why" repeatedly</li>
                <li>Most root causes are human/process issues, not technical problems</li>
                <li>Make proportional investments: small fixes for small problems, bigger investments for recurring ones</li>
                <li>Avoid "Five Blames"—focus on systems and processes, not individuals</li>
                <li>Start small and build trust before tackling contentious issues</li>
            </ul>
