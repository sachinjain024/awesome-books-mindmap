        <div class="chapter-meta">Siddhartha</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Siddhartha learns to listen to the river. He is tested again by his son's arrival and departure. Through loss and acceptance, he and Vasudeva hear the river's one word—Om—the sound of wholeness and the love of all that is.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Listening to the River</h2>
            <p>Vasudeva teaches Siddhartha to listen: to the water, to the past, to the future, to the unity of all voices. The river has no past or future—only the present. In that listening, Siddhartha begins to see that all things are connected, that time is an illusion.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the current, in the ocean and in the mountains, everywhere at once, and there is only the present time for it."
                <div class="attribution">— Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Son</h2>
            <p>Kamala dies; Siddhartha takes in his son. The boy is spoiled and rebellious. Siddhartha loves him and tries to keep him—but the river shows him that holding on is suffering. The son runs away. Siddhartha is wounded but, with Vasudeva's help, learns to let go and to see his own father in himself.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Love does not mean control. Letting go of the son is part of loving him—and part of accepting the flow of life. The river does not hold; it carries.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Om</h2>
            <p>Siddhartha and Vasudeva listen together until they hear the river's one sound: Om. It is the sound of perfection, of completion, of yes to all that is. Vasudeva goes into the forest to die in unity. Siddhartha remains as the ferryman—no longer seeking, simply being, loving the world.</p>
