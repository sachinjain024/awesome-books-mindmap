            <h4>Death Speaks</h4>
            <p>"Max Vandenburg had spent his entire life fighting. Fists, survival, the constant battle against giving up. But in a basement in Molching, he found a different kind of fight: the fight to make something beautiful."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Shared Nightmares</h2>
            <p>Liesel still wakes screaming. Her dead brother visits every night. But now there is someone else who understands—someone who wakes in darkness, drenched in cold sweat, seeing faces he couldn't save.</p>
            <p>Max tells Liesel about his nightmares. About his family marched away. About his guilt for hiding while they were taken. About the train he imagines but never saw.</p>
            <p>They trade ghosts in the basement dark. Neither is alone anymore.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Liesel's Gift</h2>
            <p>For Liesel's twelfth birthday, Hans gives her two books—The Dream Carrier and another—bought with precious rationed funds. But the gift that matters most comes from the basement.</p>
            <p>Max has been working for weeks. Using the pages of Mein Kampf, painting over Hitler's words, he has created something new: a picture book.</p>
            <p>It is called The Standover Man.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stolen-book">
            <h4>The Standover Man</h4>
            <p>Max's painted book tells the story of his life—but reimagined. Stick figures on whitewashed pages of Mein Kampf show the "standover men" of his life: people who have stood over him while he lay vulnerable.</p>
            <p>The final standover man is a girl. "All my life, I've been scared of men standing over me," Max writes. "But now I see her, this girl, and I am not afraid."</p>
            <p>It is a love letter in stick figures. A story written on the bones of hate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="book-quote">
            <p>"All my life, I've been scared of men standing over me. I suppose my first standover man was my father... But I don't remember. The next would be my uncle... But I don't remember his face either... Then there was Max the human, Max the Jew—that scary, scary man—standing over me... And now the book thief. She was the last standover man I ever expected."</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Words as Weapons</h2>
            <p>In painting over Mein Kampf, Max demonstrates something profound: words can be reclaimed. The same pages that carried Hitler's hatred now carry a story of friendship, survival, and hope.</p>
            <p>Language is not neutral. It can be used to build concentration camps or to build bridges between lonely hearts. Max chooses bridges.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Fist-Fighter and the Book Thief</h2>
            <p>Max teaches Liesel to fight with her fists. Liesel teaches Max the words she learns at school. They trade knowledge in the basement while the world above burns.</p>
            <p>Max does push-ups to stay strong. Liesel reads aloud to give him stories. They play games with words, compete to find the most interesting entry in the dictionary.</p>
            <p>It is almost normal. It is almost a family.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Reflects</h4>
            <p>"I've seen so many people die in misery and isolation. But I've also seen this: two haunted humans, one hiding from death, one carrying it in her dreams, finding each other in a German basement."</p>
            <p>"It wasn't romantic. It wasn't even friendship, exactly. It was recognition. It was: you understand what it is to carry ghosts."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hope-box">
            <h4>The Weather Report</h4>
            <p>Every day, Liesel describes the sky to Max. He cannot go outside. He cannot look through windows. But through Liesel's words, he sees clouds and sun, rain and stars.</p>
            <p>"The sky is blue like your eyes," she tells him once, lying. His eyes are brown. But she wants to give him something beautiful.</p>
            <p>Words become his window to the world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Dangerous Times</h2>
            <p>The war grows worse. Air raids begin. When the sirens sound, the Hubermanns must go to the basement shelter—but Max is already in their basement. They cannot move him. They cannot take him to the public shelter.</p>
            <p>So they leave him. Every air raid, Max lies alone in the dark, listening to bombs fall, wondering if this will be the end.</p>
            <p>Hans covers Max with a sheet to disguise him. Rosa leaves him food. Liesel whispers goodbye each time, never knowing if she'll see him again.</p>
