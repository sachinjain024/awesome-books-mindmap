        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Speaks</h4>
            <p>"I tried to keep my distance from Himmel Street. I had already been there too many times. But when the bombs came, when the sky turned red, I had no choice. I had to collect them all."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Night the Bombs Fell</h2>
            <p>There is no siren. The bombs come without warning. In the middle of the night, Himmel Street is destroyed.</p>
            <p>The Hubermanns. The Steiners. Frau Holtzapfel. Frau Diller. Every family, every house, every life on that street—gone in an instant of fire and collapse.</p>
            <p>Everyone except Liesel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tragedy-box">
            <h4>The Basement Saves Her</h4>
            <p>Liesel is in the basement, writing her book. The words save her life—literally. She is underground, surrounded by painted letters on the wall, finishing the story of everyone she loves.</p>
            <p>Above her, the world ends. She does not hear the bomb. She does not feel the explosion. She only knows something is wrong when dust begins to fall and the ceiling shakes.</p>
            <p>When she climbs out, Himmel Street is gone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Finding Them</h2>
            <p>Liesel walks through the rubble. She finds Hans first, his accordion crushed beside him. Rosa is nearby, her cardboard face finally peaceful. She finds the Steiners—all of them, including Rudy.</p>
            <p>Rudy is dead. Lemon hair covered in dust, blue eyes closed forever.</p>
            <p>Liesel kneels beside him. She wipes the debris from his face. And then, finally—too late—she kisses him.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="book-quote">
            <p>"She leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Liesel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the glow of the anarchist's suit collection. She kissed him long and soft, and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with her fingers... She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few more minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground. It amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down their faces and they stagger on..."</p>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Watches</h4>
            <p>"I saw the book thief three times. The first, on a train, when her brother died. The second, at a book burning. The third, when Himmel Street was bombed."</p>
            <p>"She was kneeling in the wreckage, kissing a dead boy, and I wanted to stop everything. I wanted to say: Liesel, it's me. I took your brother. I took your Mama and Papa. I will take everyone eventually. But today, I am giving something back."</p>
            <p>"I picked up her book from the rubble."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Book Survives</h2>
            <p>Liesel's handwritten book—The Book Thief—is buried in the debris. Death finds it. He picks it up and reads it while the rescue workers search for survivors.</p>
            <p>It is the story of her life. Every person she loved. Every book she stole. Every word she learned to read in a basement with a silver-eyed man.</p>
            <p>Death keeps the book. He will return it to her one day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>After</h2>
            <p>Liesel is taken in by the mayor and his wife. Ilsa Hermann, who left the window open, who gave her the dictionary, who understood her hunger—she becomes Liesel's new family.</p>
            <p>Liesel grows up. The war ends. She survives, though survival feels like a punishment sometimes. She carries everyone she lost inside her, written in words that will not fade.</p>
