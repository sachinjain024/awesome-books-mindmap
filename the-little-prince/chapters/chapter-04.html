        <h1 class="chapter-title">The Journey Through Asteroids</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">The Little Prince</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The little prince visits six asteroids. On each he meets a grown-up: a king, a vain man, a drunkard, a businessman, a lamplighter, and a geographer. Each encounter shows how adults can become trapped in roles that have nothing to do with meaning or love.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The King, the Vain Man, the Drunkard</h2>
            <p>The king commands everything but has no one to command; the vain man wants only to be admired; the drunkard drinks to forget the shame of drinking. The prince finds them odd. They are alone on their asteroids, absorbed in themselves.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Grown-ups are certainly very odd."
                <div class="attribution">— The Little Prince</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Businessman and the Lamplighter</h2>
            <p>The businessman counts stars he believes he owns—he is "busy with matters of consequence." The lamplighter is the only one the prince admires: his work has meaning (lighting and extinguishing the lamp), and he is faithful to it even though his planet now turns every minute.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Matters of "consequence" for grown-ups are often empty—owning, counting, ruling. The lamplighter matters because he serves something beyond himself. The prince is drawn to purpose and devotion.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Geographer</h2>
            <p>The geographer records mountains and seas but never leaves his desk; he relies on explorers. He advises the prince to visit Earth. So the little prince comes to our planet—and there he will meet the fox and learn what "taming" means.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Many adults are absorbed in roles that give no real meaning—power, admiration, possession.</li>
                <li>Work that serves others (like the lamplighter's) can be worthy of respect.</li>
                <li>The journey from asteroid to asteroid is a journey through different ways of (mis)living.</li>
            </ul>
