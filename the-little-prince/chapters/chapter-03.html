        <h1 class="chapter-title">The Prince's Planet</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">The Little Prince</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The little prince's home is a tiny asteroid with three volcanoes (one extinct) and a single rose. He cleans the volcanoes, pulls baobab seedlings, and cares for the rose—but her vanity and demands confuse him, so he leaves to understand more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Rose</h2>
            <p>The rose is beautiful and unique to the prince, but she is also vain and difficult. She asks for a screen and a glass globe, and she coughs to get attention. The prince takes her words literally and feels hurt. He does not yet understand that her behavior is a way of loving—and that he is responsible for her.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed."
                <div class="attribution">— The Fox, The Little Prince</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Tending the Planet</h2>
            <p>The prince's daily tasks—pulling small baobabs before they take over, cleaning the volcanoes—teach discipline and care. His planet is small; one step can take him around it. But that smallness makes every detail meaningful.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Responsibility is not a burden but a bond. The prince will learn from the fox that it is the time he gave to his rose that makes her unique in all the world.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Those we love can be difficult; love includes accepting and caring anyway.</li>
                <li>We are responsible for what we have tamed—for the bonds we create.</li>
                <li>Small worlds can hold great meaning when we tend them with care.</li>
            </ul>
