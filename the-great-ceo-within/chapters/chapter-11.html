        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Four: Strategy & Governance</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The board can be a source of support, advice, and accountability—or a source of friction and confusion. This chapter covers how to prepare for board meetings, run them effectively, and build trust so your board becomes an asset to the company.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Board's Role</h2>
            <p>The board oversees the company on behalf of shareholders: they hire and evaluate the CEO, approve major decisions (e.g., fundraising, M&A), and provide strategic advice. They're not there to run the company—you are. A good board holds you accountable to results and supports you with experience and networks. A bad board micromanages or disengages.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>No surprises. Board members who are surprised in the meeting will lose trust. Share hard news in advance (e.g., in the pre-read or a call) so the meeting can focus on discussion and decisions.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Preparing for Board Meetings</h2>
            <p>Send a board deck or memo at least 2–3 days before the meeting. Include: metrics and progress vs. plan, key wins and challenges, decisions you need from the board, and any sensitive topics (so they're not hearing it for the first time live). Keep it scannable: exec summary, then detail. The goal is for the board to come in informed so the meeting is discussion, not presentation.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>Board Pre-Read Contents</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Executive summary (key metrics, wins, challenges)</li>
                    <li>Financials and KPIs vs. plan</li>
                    <li>Decisions needed from the board</li>
                    <li>Risks or issues (no surprises in the room)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Running the Meeting</h2>
            <p>Have an agenda and stick to it. Allocate time for each topic. Leave room for discussion and questions—don't fill the whole time with slides. For decisions, be clear on what you're asking and get explicit approval or direction. End with action items and owners. Follow up in writing so there's a record.</p>

                "The best board meetings are conversations, not presentations. Use the pre-read to inform; use the meeting to discuss, decide, and align."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Building Trust</h2>
            <p>Trust comes from consistency: you say what you'll do, you do it, and you share the truth—good and bad. Have 1:1s with board members between meetings so you're aligned and they hear from you directly. When something goes wrong, tell them first; don't let them find out from someone else. The more they trust you, the more they can help.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Hiding problems or spinning the numbers. Boards find out. When they do, trust collapses. Share challenges early and ask for help; that's what the board is for.</p>
