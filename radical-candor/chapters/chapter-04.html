        <div class="chapter-meta">Part 2: Get, Give, and Encourage Guidance</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Giving criticism is harder than giving praise, but it's also more important. Most managers default to Ruinous Empathy—avoiding hard conversations to spare feelings. This chapter shows how to deliver criticism that actually helps people improve.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Criticism Is an Act of Kindness</h2>
            <p>Withholding criticism isn't kind—it's cruel. When you don't tell people about problems, you rob them of the chance to improve.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Criticism Is Kindness When:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It helps someone improve at their job</li>
                    <li>It prevents small problems from becoming big problems</li>
                    <li>It shows you care enough to have a hard conversation</li>
                    <li>It gives people a chance to fix issues before it's too late</li>
                    <li>It respects their ability to handle the truth</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>The HIP Principle (for Criticism)</h2>
            <p>Good criticism is Humble, Helpful, and delivered Immediately in Person.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>HIP Criticism</h4>
                <p><strong>Humble:</strong> "I may be wrong, but..." or "Here's what I observed..." Show you're not infallible.</p>
                <p><strong>Helpful:</strong> Focus on how they can improve, not just what went wrong. Make it actionable.</p>
                <p><strong>Immediate:</strong> Don't wait for annual reviews. Give feedback right away.</p>
                <p><strong>In Person:</strong> Have the conversation face-to-face or via video. Don't hide behind email or Slack.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Be Direct (Not Mean)</h2>
            <p>Clarity is kind. Don't hint, sugarcoat, or "sandwich" criticism between praise. Say what you mean clearly and directly.</p>

            <h2>Criticize in Private (Usually)</h2>
            <p>Unlike praise, criticism should almost always be given in private. Public criticism humiliates people and shuts down learning.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>When Public Criticism Goes Wrong</h4>
                <p>Public criticism:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Humiliates the person being criticized</li>
                    <li>Makes everyone else uncomfortable</li>
                    <li>Triggers defensiveness, not learning</li>
                    <li>Damages trust and psychological safety</li>
                    <li>Teaches everyone to hide mistakes</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Exception:</strong> If someone publicly does something that violates team values (e.g., disrespects a colleague), address it immediately but focus on the behavior, not attacking the person.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Don't Personalize</h2>
            <p>Criticize the work or behavior, not the person. "You're careless" attacks identity. "This report has errors" addresses the work.</p>

            <div class="challenge-box">

            <h2>The "Um" Story</h2>
            <p>Kim Scott shares the story that inspired the book: her boss at Google told her she said "um" every third word, making her sound stupid. This feedback was:</p>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h4>Why This Feedback Worked</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Not "you need to communicate better" but "you say 'um' too much"</li>
                    <li><strong>Delivered with care:</strong> Her boss clearly cared about her success</li>
                    <li><strong>Actionable:</strong> She could work with a speech coach to fix it</li>
                    <li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Given right after a presentation</li>
                    <li><strong>Private:</strong> In a one-on-one, not in front of the team</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The criticism was hard to hear, but it changed her career. That's Radical Candor.</p>
