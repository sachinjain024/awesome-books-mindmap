        <div class="chapter-meta">A Man Called Ove</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Ove is fifty-nine. He has strict rules about how things should be done—parking, trash, the right kind of car. His wife Sonja has died. He has been forced to retire. He sees no reason to stay. He is planning to end his life—but first he has to make sure the neighborhood is in order. The novel introduces us to the grumpy surface; underneath is grief and a man who once knew how to love.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Grumpy Man</h2>
            <p>Ove is the neighbor who writes angry letters, enforces rules, and refuses to accept change. He drives a Saab, believes in doing things yourself, and has no patience for incompetence. But his rigidity is also a form of care—he wants the world to work. When it doesn't, and when the person who gave his life meaning is gone, he has nothing left to hold on to.</p>

            <h4>Key Insight</h4>
            <p>Ove's grumpiness is a mask for loss. Sonja was his color—his reason. Without her he has decided he is done. The novel will show that purpose can return when we let others need us.</p>
