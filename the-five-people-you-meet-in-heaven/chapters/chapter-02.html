        <div class="intro">
            <p>In heaven Eddie finds himself at Ruby Pier as it was when he was a child. The first person who meets him is the Blue Man—from the sideshow. He tells Eddie that when Eddie was a small boy, he ran into the street after a ball. The Blue Man swerved his car to avoid him and died in the crash. Eddie had no idea. There are no random acts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>No Random Acts</h2>
            <p>The Blue Man says: "There are no random acts. We are all connected. You can no more separate one life from another than you can separate a breeze from the wind." Eddie's guilt is real—but so is the larger truth. We are part of one another's stories; we affect people we never know.</p>

            <h4>Key Insight</h4>
            <p>We carry guilt for things we didn't intend—and we are also part of a web where every life touches others. Understanding that can free us from the illusion that we are alone or that our life doesn't matter.</p>
