        <div class="chapter-meta">Life of Pi</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Pi Patel grows up in Pondicherry, India, where his father runs a zoo. Pi loves animals and stories. As a teenager he explores three religions—Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam—and decides he wants to love God through all of them. His family plans to move to Canada; they board a Japanese freighter with the animals.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Faith in Many Forms</h2>
            <p>Pi's parents are secular; his brother mocks him. But Pi finds something true in each tradition—the color and devotion of Hinduism, the sacrifice of Christ, the discipline and surrender of Islam. "I just want to love God," he says. The pandit, priest, and imam argue; Pi refuses to choose one. Faith, for him, is not a single path.</p>

            <h2>The Zoo</h2>
            <p>Growing up in the zoo teaches Pi about animal nature—territory, dominance, survival. His father once made him watch a tiger kill a goat to show that the tiger is not his friend. That lesson will save Pi on the lifeboat: he knows he must establish dominance and boundaries with Richard Parker.</p>

                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Pi's openness to multiple faiths and his understanding of animals are both forms of seeing the world as it is—and as something more. Both will sustain him in the Pacific.</p>
