        <div class="chapter-meta">Part 7: A Society of Addicts</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Leadership is not a rank or title. It's a choice—the choice to look after the person to your left and the person to your right. This final chapter provides a path forward for anyone who wants to lead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Leadership Is a Choice</h2>
            <p>You don't need permission or a title to be a leader. You just need to start taking care of those around you.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Leadership is not about being in charge. It's about taking care of those in your charge."
                <div class="attribution">— Simon Sinek</div>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Anyone Can Lead</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look after your teammates</li>
                    <li>Protect others from harm</li>
                    <li>Share credit, take blame</li>
                    <li>Put the group before yourself</li>
                    <li>Create safety for those around you</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Building Your Circle of Safety</h2>
            <p>Start small. You can't fix an entire organization overnight, but you can create safety for your immediate team.</p>

            <div class="safety-box">
                <h4>How to Begin</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Be present:</strong> Put away devices, give people your attention</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen:</strong> Really hear what people are saying</li>
                    <li><strong>Show you care:</strong> Small acts of kindness build oxytocin</li>
                    <li><strong>Admit mistakes:</strong> Vulnerability creates safety</li>
                    <li><strong>Give credit:</strong> Recognize others' contributions</li>
                    <li><strong>Protect your people:</strong> Shield them from internal threats</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Ripple Effect</h2>
            <p>When you create safety for those around you, they feel empowered to do the same for others. Trust spreads.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>How Change Happens</h4>
                <p>You don't need to be CEO to change a culture. One person creating safety creates a ripple. Others notice and join. Eventually, the culture shifts.</p>
                <p>It starts with you choosing to eat last.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Commitment</h2>
            <p>Leadership requires sacrifice. The question is: are you willing to eat last?</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>The Leader's Commitment</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I will put the group before myself</li>
                    <li>I will protect those in my care</li>
                    <li>I will share credit and take responsibility</li>
                    <li>I will create safety so others can contribute their best</li>
                    <li>I will sacrifice my comfort for the good of the team</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Choice Is Yours</h2>
            <p>Sinek ends where he began: with a choice. Will you be the kind of leader people follow because they want to? Or because they have to?</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The true price of leadership is the willingness to place the needs of others above your own. Great leaders truly care about those they are privileged to lead."
