        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>Siddhartha and Govinda hear of the Buddha, Gotama, and go to hear his teaching. Siddhartha recognizes the Buddha's perfection but decides that even this teaching cannot give him what he seeks—he must find it himself.</p>
<h2>Meeting the Buddha</h2>
<p>Gotama's presence is serene and complete. His teaching of the chain of cause and effect, suffering, and the path to release is coherent and compelling. Govinda joins the Buddha's followers. Siddhartha respects the teaching—but something in him resists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, be fortified by it, but one cannot communicate and teach it.&quot;
— Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Choosing His Own Path</h2>
<p>Siddhartha tells the Buddha that his doctrine may be perfect, but in it there is one gap: how did the Buddha himself attain enlightenment? It was not through the doctrine—it was through his own experience. Siddhartha decides he must seek the same way: through life itself.</p>
<h3>Key Insight {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>Even the best teaching is a finger pointing at the moon—not the moon itself. Your awakening cannot be borrowed; it must be lived. Siddhartha chooses the world as his teacher.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wisdom cannot be communicated; it must be found and lived.</li>
<li>Respecting a teacher does not require following their path—your path may be your own.</li>
<li>Experience, not doctrine alone, leads to awakening.</li>
<li>Leaving even the best teaching can be the next step on the journey.</li>
</ul>
