            <h2>About This Book</h2>
<p>Hermann Hesse's novel follows Siddhartha from his Brahmin upbringing through asceticism, sensual life, and wealth, to the river and the ferryman. It is a story about finding wisdom not through doctrine but through lived experience and the unity of all things.</p>
<p>This mind map traces Siddhartha's journey from spiritual seeker to worldly man to enlightened ferryman, revealing how wisdom emerges not from teachings alone but from the full embrace of life's experiences—both sacred and profane.</p>

            <h3>Core Stoic Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Experience over doctrine:</strong> Wisdom cannot be handed down; it must be lived.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Your path is yours:</strong> Even the Buddha&#39;s teaching is a map, not the territory.</li>
                
                <li><strong>The river:</strong> Time and the present are one; the river holds all voices and all times.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Om:</strong> The sound of wholeness; acceptance of what is, and love for the world.</li>
