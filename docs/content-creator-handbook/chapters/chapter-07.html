            <div class="insight-text">"The algorithm isn't mysterious. It has one job: keep people on the platform. Once you understand that, everything else follows."</div>

            <h2>One Goal: Session Time</h2>
            <p>YouTube's business model is simple: show ads to viewers. To show more ads, they need viewers to watch more. The algorithm's entire purpose is to maximize how long people stay on the platform.</p>
            <p>This means the algorithm promotes content that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gets clicked (brings viewers to the platform)</li>
                <li>Gets watched (keeps viewers on the platform)</li>
                <li>Leads to more watching (triggers more sessions)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h3>The Key Metrics YouTube Watches</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Click-Through Rate (CTR):</strong> What percentage of people who see your video click on it</li>
                <li><strong>Average View Duration (AVD):</strong> How long people watch on average</li>
                <li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed (APV):</strong> What portion of your video they watch</li>
                <li><strong>Session Time:</strong> How much total YouTube time your video triggers</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Algorithm's Testing Process</h2>
            <p>When you publish a video, YouTube shows it to a small sample of your subscribers and people with relevant interests. Based on how that sample responds, YouTube decides whether to push it wider.</p>
            <p>The testing stages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Shown to ~100-500 people (often subscribers)</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> If CTR and AVD are good, pushed to ~1,000-5,000</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Good performance = pushed to broader audience segments</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Strong videos get browse/suggested placement</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="metric-box">
            <span class="metric-value">CTR × AVD</span>
            <span class="metric-label">The simplified formula for algorithmic success</span>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Traffic Sources Explained</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Browse features:</strong> YouTube homepage — high CTR + AVD gets you here</li>
                <li><strong>Suggested videos:</strong> Sidebar and end screens — topic relevance + engagement</li>
                <li><strong>Search:</strong> YouTube SEO — keyword relevance + video performance</li>
                <li><strong>External:</strong> From social media, websites, etc. — you control this</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Subscribers with bell enabled — subscriber loyalty</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <h4>Common Mistake: Optimizing for One Metric</h4>
            <p>Clickbait thumbnails boost CTR but tank retention. Boring intros protect watch time but kill CTR. The algorithm wants both — click-worthy AND watch-worthy. Optimizing one at the expense of the other doesn't work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Real Truth About "Beating" the Algorithm</h2>
            <p>You don't beat the algorithm — you align with it. The algorithm wants to surface content viewers will love. If you make content viewers genuinely love, you and the algorithm are on the same team.</p>
            <p>Stop asking "what does the algorithm want?" and start asking "what does my audience want?" The answers are usually the same.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pro-tip">
            <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
            <p>Check your Analytics → Audience → When Your Viewers Are On YouTube. Publishing when your audience is online gives you a better first-hour performance, which helps the algorithm's initial testing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-step">
            <h4>Action Steps</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Study your Analytics dashboard — especially CTR, AVD, and traffic sources</li>
                <li>For your top 5 videos, note what CTR and AVD they achieved</li>
                <li>For your bottom 5, identify where the metrics fell short</li>
                <li>Look for patterns in what the algorithm rewards for YOUR content</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The algorithm exists to maximize viewer session time</li>
                <li>CTR and AVD are the two most critical metrics</li>
                <li>YouTube tests videos in stages — early performance determines reach</li>
                <li>Clickbait without substance doesn't work long-term</li>
                <li>Align with the algorithm by making content viewers genuinely love</li>
            </ul>
