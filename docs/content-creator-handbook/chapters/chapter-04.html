<p>“Early in your career, access is worth more than money. A conversation with the right person can change your trajectory more than a ₹50,000 brand deal.”
— Varun Mayya</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Two Currencies</h2>
<p>As a creator, you operate with two currencies: access and money. Access means relationships, opportunities, doors that open, people who take your calls. Money is… money.</p>
<p>The mistake many creators make is optimizing for money too early, when access would provide far more long-term value.</p>

<h2>What Access Provides</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaborations:</strong> Partnering with established creators exposes you to their audience</li>
<li><strong>Learning:</strong> Behind-the-scenes knowledge that isn’t in any course</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Speaking gigs, podcast appearances, business partnerships</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> Guidance from people who’ve been where you are</li>
<li><strong>Deal flow:</strong> Better brand deals come through relationships, not cold emails</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="common-mistake">Common Mistake: Monetizing Too Early</h3>
<p>Taking every small brand deal when you have a small audience often trades long-term reputation for short-term cash. Viewers can tell when content is primarily motivated by sponsorship, and it erodes trust that takes years to build back.</p>
<h2>How to Build Access</h2>
<p>Access isn’t given — it’s earned through value creation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be genuinely useful:</strong> Help people without expecting immediate return</li>
<li><strong>Create quality content:</strong> Your work is your calling card</li>
<li><strong>Show up consistently:</strong> Be a regular presence in communities</li>
<li><strong>Reach out thoughtfully:</strong> Personalized, specific requests beat generic pitches</li>
<li><strong>Follow through:</strong> Reliability builds reputation faster than talent</li>
</ul>
<h2>When to Flip the Ratio</h2>
<p>Eventually, you need to monetize. Signs it’s time to shift more toward money:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re burning out because you can’t sustain the pace unpaid</li>
<li>You have enough audience that brands approach you (not the reverse)</li>
<li>You’ve built genuine relationships that won’t be damaged by commercial activity</li>
<li>You can be selective about partnerships that align with your values</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="pro-tip">Pro Tip</h3>
<p>Keep a “relationship CRM” — a simple spreadsheet of people you’ve met, what you talked about, and how you might help them. The creators who build empires are almost always exceptional at maintaining relationships.</p>
<h3 class="action-step">Action Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify 10 creators you’d love to know — what value could you offer them?</li>
<li>Audit your current activity: How much is optimizing for money vs. access?</li>
<li>For the next 3 months, prioritize one over the other intentionally</li>
<li>Track relationship-building activities like you track views</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Early in your journey, access typically provides more long-term value than money</li>
<li>Relationships open doors that cold outreach can’t</li>
<li>Monetizing too early can damage trust and limit growth</li>
<li>Build access by creating genuine value for others</li>
<li>Shift the ratio as your leverage increases</li>
</ul>
