<p>“The fear never fully goes away. You just learn to create alongside it. Every successful creator you admire still feels resistance — they’ve just stopped letting it win.”
— Achina Mayya</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Universal Resistance</h2>
<p>Every creator faces the same internal resistance: the voice that says “not yet,” “not good enough,” “what will people think?” This resistance is universal, predictable, and — if you let it — career-ending.</p>
<p>Steven Pressfield called it “The Resistance” in his book The War of Art. It’s the force that stands between you and your creative work. It’s not personal; it attacks everyone equally.</p>
<h3 class="strategy-box">Common Forms of Resistance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfectionism:</strong> “I need better equipment/skills/ideas first”</li>
<li><strong>Imposter syndrome:</strong> “Who am I to talk about this?”</li>
<li><strong>Fear of judgment:</strong> “What will my friends/family/strangers think?”</li>
<li><strong>Comparison paralysis:</strong> “Others are already better at this”</li>
<li><strong>Analysis paralysis:</strong> “I need to research more before starting”</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Cost of Not Starting</h2>
<p>Resistance feels like it’s protecting you, but it’s actually stealing from you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lost time:</strong> Every day you don’t start is a day you could have been improving</li>
<li><strong>Stagnant skills:</strong> You can’t get good at creating content without creating content</li>
<li><strong>No feedback:</strong> The audience can’t tell you what works until you publish</li>
<li><strong>Missed opportunities:</strong> The next big thing might have been your next video</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="common-mistake">Common Mistake: Waiting Until You’re “Ready”</h3>
<p>You will never feel ready. The feeling of readiness comes after you start, not before. Every creator’s first videos are embarrassing to them now — but without those videos, they never would have gotten good.</p>
<h2>Strategies for Overcoming Resistance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower the stakes:</strong> Your first 50 videos are practice. They don’t need to be good.</li>
<li><strong>Set a ship date:</strong> “This publishes Friday regardless of how I feel”</li>
<li><strong>Quantity commitment:</strong> Commit to 100 videos before judging results</li>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Tell someone your publishing schedule</li>
<li><strong>Start small:</strong> A 60-second video is easier than a 20-minute one</li>
<li><strong>Separate creation from editing:</strong> Create first, judge later</li>
</ul>
<h2>The First Video Trap</h2>
<p>Your first video is not the start of your career — it’s the end of not having started. It’s supposed to be bad. It’s supposed to feel scary. That’s the point.</p>
<p>The creators you admire have dozens of terrible early videos they hope you’ll never find. Their careers started despite those videos, not because they waited until they were perfect.</p>
<h3 class="pro-tip">Pro Tip</h3>
<p>Make your first video unlisted or delete it after a week. This removes the permanence fear. You’re not committing to anything — just practicing publishing.</p>
<h3 class="action-step">Action Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write down specifically what you’re afraid of — seeing it helps defuse it</li>
<li>Set a deadline: Your first video will be published by [specific date]</li>
<li>Tell one person this deadline to create accountability</li>
<li>Create your first video today, even if it’s just you talking to your phone for 60 seconds</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Resistance is universal — every creator faces it</li>
<li>Waiting until you’re “ready” means waiting forever</li>
<li>Your first videos are supposed to be bad — that’s how learning works</li>
<li>Lower the stakes: commit to quantity, not quality, initially</li>
<li>The cost of not starting exceeds the cost of starting badly</li>
</ul>
