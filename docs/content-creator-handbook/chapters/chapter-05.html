<p>&quot;The fear never fully goes away. You just learn to create alongside it. Every successful creator you admire still feels resistance — they've just stopped letting it win.&quot;
— Achina Mayya</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Universal Resistance</h2>
<p>Every creator faces the same internal resistance: the voice that says &quot;not yet,&quot; &quot;not good enough,&quot; &quot;what will people think?&quot; This resistance is universal, predictable, and — if you let it — career-ending.</p>
<p>Steven Pressfield called it &quot;The Resistance&quot; in his book The War of Art. It's the force that stands between you and your creative work. It's not personal; it attacks everyone equally.</p>
<h3>Common Forms of Resistance {.strategy-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfectionism:</strong> &quot;I need better equipment/skills/ideas first&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Imposter syndrome:</strong> &quot;Who am I to talk about this?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Fear of judgment:</strong> &quot;What will my friends/family/strangers think?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Comparison paralysis:</strong> &quot;Others are already better at this&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Analysis paralysis:</strong> &quot;I need to research more before starting&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Cost of Not Starting</h2>
<p>Resistance feels like it's protecting you, but it's actually stealing from you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lost time:</strong> Every day you don't start is a day you could have been improving</li>
<li><strong>Stagnant skills:</strong> You can't get good at creating content without creating content</li>
<li><strong>No feedback:</strong> The audience can't tell you what works until you publish</li>
<li><strong>Missed opportunities:</strong> The next big thing might have been your next video</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common Mistake: Waiting Until You're &quot;Ready&quot; {.common-mistake}</h3>
<p>You will never feel ready. The feeling of readiness comes after you start, not before. Every creator's first videos are embarrassing to them now — but without those videos, they never would have gotten good.</p>
<h2>Strategies for Overcoming Resistance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower the stakes:</strong> Your first 50 videos are practice. They don't need to be good.</li>
<li><strong>Set a ship date:</strong> &quot;This publishes Friday regardless of how I feel&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Quantity commitment:</strong> Commit to 100 videos before judging results</li>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Tell someone your publishing schedule</li>
<li><strong>Start small:</strong> A 60-second video is easier than a 20-minute one</li>
<li><strong>Separate creation from editing:</strong> Create first, judge later</li>
</ul>
<h2>The First Video Trap</h2>
<p>Your first video is not the start of your career — it's the end of not having started. It's supposed to be bad. It's supposed to feel scary. That's the point.</p>
<p>The creators you admire have dozens of terrible early videos they hope you'll never find. Their careers started despite those videos, not because they waited until they were perfect.</p>
<h3>Pro Tip {.pro-tip}</h3>
<p>Make your first video unlisted or delete it after a week. This removes the permanence fear. You're not committing to anything — just practicing publishing.</p>
<h3>Action Steps {.action-step}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write down specifically what you're afraid of — seeing it helps defuse it</li>
<li>Set a deadline: Your first video will be published by [specific date]</li>
<li>Tell one person this deadline to create accountability</li>
<li>Create your first video today, even if it's just you talking to your phone for 60 seconds</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Resistance is universal — every creator faces it</li>
<li>Waiting until you're &quot;ready&quot; means waiting forever</li>
<li>Your first videos are supposed to be bad — that's how learning works</li>
<li>Lower the stakes: commit to quantity, not quality, initially</li>
<li>The cost of not starting exceeds the cost of starting badly</li>
</ul>
