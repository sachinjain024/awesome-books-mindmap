            <div class="insight-text">"Humans are wired for story. Data informs, but story transforms. If you want your content to stick, wrap it in narrative."</div>

            <h2>Why Story Works</h2>
            <p>Our brains evolved to process information through story. Before writing, story was how we transmitted knowledge across generations. Facts alone don't stick — facts embedded in narrative become memorable.</p>
            <p>This is why you remember movies from 10 years ago but forget facts from yesterday's article. Story creates emotional engagement that pure information cannot.</p>

            <h3>The Basic Story Structure</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Hook:</strong> Grab attention with a compelling question or promise</li>
                <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Establish the context, characters, or stakes</li>
                <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> Present the problem, obstacle, or tension</li>
                <li><strong>Journey:</strong> Show the struggle, attempt, or exploration</li>
                <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Deliver the payoff, lesson, or answer</li>
                <li><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Make it relevant to the viewer's life</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Story Applied to Different Formats</h2>
            <p><strong>Educational content:</strong> "I had this problem → I tried these things → This worked → Here's how you can apply it"</p>
            <p><strong>Product review:</strong> "I was looking for X → I tested these options → Here's what I discovered → My recommendation"</p>
            <p><strong>Commentary:</strong> "Something happened → Why it matters → What we can learn → What might happen next"</p>
            <p>Even "non-story" content benefits from narrative structure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Hook: Your Most Important Moment</h2>
            <p>The first 5-10 seconds determine whether viewers stay. Effective hooks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Open a curiosity gap:</strong> "What if everything you knew about X was wrong?"</li>
                <li><strong>Promise specific value:</strong> "By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to..."</li>
                <li><strong>Start with action:</strong> Jump into the most interesting moment first</li>
                <li><strong>Present a problem:</strong> "You're losing money every day because of this..."</li>
                <li><strong>Make a bold claim:</strong> "This technique tripled my results in one week"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <h4>Common Mistake: The Self-Introduction Hook</h4>
            <p>"Hey guys, welcome back to my channel, my name is..." — you've already lost them. Save introductions for after you've earned their attention. Hook first, introduce later (or never).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Maintaining Tension</h2>
            <p>Story is driven by tension — the gap between "what is" and "what could be." Throughout your content, maintain tension by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Open loops:</strong> Pose questions you'll answer later</li>
                <li><strong>Foreshadowing:</strong> "But what happened next changed everything..."</li>
                <li><strong>Stakes establishment:</strong> "If this doesn't work, here's what you'll lose..."</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern interrupts:</strong> Unexpected turns that re-capture attention</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="pro-tip">
            <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
            <p>Study your audience retention graph. Where do people drop off? Those are story failures — moments where tension dissolved or interest waned. Use this data to improve your narrative structure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-step">
            <h4>Action Steps</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Take your next video idea and plot it on the story structure framework</li>
                <li>Write 5 different hooks for the same video — test which feels strongest</li>
                <li>Identify 3 "open loops" you can use to maintain tension</li>
                <li>Review your retention graphs and correlate drop-offs with story structure</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Story is how humans naturally process and remember information</li>
                <li>Even informational content benefits from narrative structure</li>
                <li>Hooks determine whether viewers give you their attention</li>
                <li>Tension (open loops, stakes, curiosity gaps) keeps viewers watching</li>
                <li>Retention graphs reveal where your storytelling is failing</li>
            </ul>
