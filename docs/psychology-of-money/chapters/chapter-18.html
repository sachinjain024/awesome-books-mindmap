            <p>The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true. We're not calculating machines—we're storytelling creatures who need narratives to make sense of the world.</p>
<p>This makes us vulnerable to believing what we want to believe, especially when it comes to money.</p>
<h3>The Power of Narrative {.concept-box}</h3>
<p>Humans don't process information like computers. We process it like storytellers. A good story—even a false one—beats a dry collection of facts every time.</p>
<p>This is why get-rich-quick schemes work, why bubbles form, and why people make financial decisions that look crazy in hindsight but felt right in the moment.</p>
<h3>The Berlin Wall {.story-box}</h3>
<p>Before November 1989, almost no expert predicted the Berlin Wall would fall. After it fell, everyone explained why it was inevitable. This hindsight bias creates the illusion that the world is more predictable than it really is.</p>
<p>We create stories that explain the past as if it were inevitable, which makes us overconfident about predicting the future.</p>

<h2>Why We Need Stories</h2>
<p>The world is incredibly complex. No one can process all the information needed to understand why things happen. So we simplify. We create narratives. We find patterns (even when they don't exist). This is how humans function.</p>
<p>The problem is that our need for stories can override our judgment about whether those stories are true.</p>
<h3>What Makes Stories Dangerous {.principle-box}</h3>
<p><strong>Confirmation bias:</strong> We seek out stories that confirm what we already believe</p>
<p><strong>Hindsight bias:</strong> Past events seem predictable, making us overconfident</p>
<p><strong>Appeal to emotion:</strong> Stories that feel right beat statistics that are right</p>
<p><strong>Complexity aversion:</strong> We prefer simple explanations even when reality is complex</p>
<h2>Financial Fictions</h2>
<p>Finance is particularly susceptible to appealing fictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;This time is different&quot;:</strong> Every bubble has a story for why old rules don't apply</li>
<li><strong>&quot;I've found the pattern&quot;:</strong> Technical analysis that &quot;works&quot; until it doesn't</li>
<li><strong>&quot;The genius investor&quot;:</strong> Stories of skill that might just be luck</li>
<li><strong>&quot;It can only go up&quot;:</strong> Housing in 2006, tech in 1999, tulips in 1637</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Bubble Narrative {.warning-box}</h3>
<p>Every bubble comes with a compelling story about why this time is different. The dot-com bubble had &quot;the new economy.&quot; The housing bubble had &quot;housing never goes down.&quot; The story justifies prices that would otherwise seem insane.</p>
<p>When prices crash, we wonder how anyone believed the story. In the moment, the story felt irresistible.</p>
<h2>Incomplete Information</h2>
<p>We never have complete information about anything. The world is too complex. So we fill in the gaps with stories. The danger is forgetting that our understanding is always partial, always constructed.</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't know as much as you think you know</li>
<li>Experts don't know as much as they claim to know</li>
<li>The future is more uncertain than any story suggests</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protecting Yourself</h2>
<p>You can't stop being a storytelling creature—that's fundamental to being human. But you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be skeptical of certainty:</strong> Especially your own</li>
<li><strong>Look for disconfirming evidence:</strong> Actively seek out stories that challenge your beliefs</li>
<li><strong>Accept uncertainty:</strong> Most things are less predictable than we pretend</li>
<li><strong>Question appealing stories:</strong> If it sounds too good to be true, examine why you want to believe it</li>
<li><strong>Remember hindsight bias:</strong> The past looks predictable only in retrospect</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>We're storytelling creatures:</strong> Narratives beat statistics in shaping our beliefs</li>
<li><strong>Desire shapes belief:</strong> We believe what we want to be true</li>
<li><strong>Hindsight creates illusions:</strong> The past seems predictable only after it happens</li>
<li><strong>Bubbles are stories:</strong> Every mania has a compelling narrative</li>
<li><strong>Stay humble:</strong> Your understanding is always incomplete</li>
</ul>
