            <p>Getting money and keeping money are two different skills. Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. Keeping money requires the opposite: humility, fear, and acceptance that some of what you've made can be taken away just as fast.</p>
<p>Many people are good at one of these but not both. The rare few who master both become truly wealthy over time.</p>
<h3>Jesse Livermore's Tragedy {.story-box}</h3>
<p>Jesse Livermore was perhaps the greatest stock trader who ever lived. In a single day in 1929, he made the equivalent of $3 billion in today's money by shorting the market during the crash. He had won.</p>
<p>But by 1940, Jesse Livermore was broke. He took his own life. The same traits that made him spectacularly successful—aggressive risk-taking, bold bets, unwavering confidence—eventually destroyed him.</p>

<h2>Nassim Taleb's Insight</h2>
<p>Nassim Taleb puts it simply: &quot;Having an 'edge' and surviving are two different things: the first requires the second. You need to avoid ruin. At all costs.&quot;</p>
<p>The first rule of compounding: never interrupt it unnecessarily. If you earn good returns but blow up even once, you might never recover. Survival is the foundation on which everything else is built.</p>
<h3>The Power of Survival {.concept-box}</h3>
<p>Consider two investors:</p>
<p><strong>Investor A:</strong> Earns 20% returns for 5 years, then loses everything in year 6.</p>
<p><strong>Investor B:</strong> Earns 8% returns for 40 years without interruption.</p>
<p>Investor B wins by a landslide—not because of skill, but because of survival. Compounding only works if you stay in the game long enough.</p>
<h2>How to Stay Wealthy {.principle-box}</h2>
<p><strong>1. More Than I Want Big Returns, I Want to Be Financially Unbreakable</strong></p>
<p>If you can survive the worst that markets throw at you, you'll be around to capture the gains when they come. This means having a plan for when things go wrong, not just when they go right.</p>
<p><strong>2. Planning Is Important, but the Most Important Part Is Planning for Things to Not Go as Planned</strong></p>
<p>No plan survives first contact with reality. The plans that work account for uncertainty by building in room for error.</p>
<p><strong>3. A Barbelled Personality</strong></p>
<p>Be optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what might prevent you from getting there. Combine ambition with caution. This sounds contradictory, but it's essential.</p>
<h3>The Fatal Mistake {.warning-box}</h3>
<p>The most common mistake is to take the skills that got you wealthy and assume they'll keep you wealthy. But the mindset required to build from nothing is often the opposite of the mindset required to preserve and grow what you have.</p>
<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>If you can combine the optimism necessary to take risks with the paranoia necessary to survive, you'll be positioned for long-term success. Neither trait alone is sufficient:</p>
<ul>
<li>All optimism with no caution leads to ruin</li>
<li>All caution with no optimism leads to stagnation</li>
<li>The combination—being an optimistic paranoid—is the sweet spot</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Different skills are required:</strong> Getting wealthy requires risk; staying wealthy requires caution</li>
<li><strong>Survival is paramount:</strong> If you don't survive, you can't compound</li>
<li><strong>Be an optimistic paranoid:</strong> Hopeful about the future, terrified of what could go wrong</li>
<li><strong>Plan for the unplanned:</strong> The best plans account for uncertainty</li>
<li><strong>Avoid ruin at all costs:</strong> One catastrophic loss can wipe out decades of gains</li>
</ul>
