            <p>Housel uses this chapter to summarize the key lessons from the book. These aren’t rules to follow blindly—they’re principles to help you think about money in a healthier, more productive way.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">1. Go Out of Your Way to Find Humility</h3>
<p>When things go right, recognize luck’s role. When things go wrong, recognize risk’s role. This prevents overconfidence during success and self-destruction during failure.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">2. Less Ego, More Wealth</h3>
<p>Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income. Wealth is created by suppressing what you could buy today in order to have more options in the future.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">3. Manage Your Money in a Way That Helps You Sleep at Night</h3>
<p>The right investment strategy isn’t necessarily the one with the highest returns—it’s the one you can stick with. If aggressive investing keeps you up at night, dial it back.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">4. Increase Your Time Horizon</h3>
<p>Time is the most powerful force in investing. Compounding doesn’t work in years; it works in decades. The biggest gains come to those who wait.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">5. Be OK with Things Going Wrong</h3>
<p>You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune if your successes are big enough. Accept small losses as the price of being positioned for big wins.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">6. Use Money to Gain Control Over Your Time</h3>
<p>The highest dividend money pays is the ability to control your time. This is worth more than any purchase or status symbol.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">7. Be Nicer and Less Flashy</h3>
<p>No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are. Wealth is what you don’t see—the money not spent, the status not flaunted.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">8. Save Without a Specific Goal</h3>
<p>Savings without a purpose gives you flexibility and options. You don’t need a reason to save beyond wanting more control over your future.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">9. Define the Cost of Success and Be Ready to Pay It</h3>
<p>Every investment strategy has a price—volatility, uncertainty, doubt. Think of it as a fee, not a fine. If you’re not willing to pay the price, don’t expect the returns.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">10. Worship Room for Error</h3>
<p>The most important part of every plan is planning for the plan not going according to plan. Build margins of safety into every financial decision.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">11. Avoid Extreme Financial Decisions</h3>
<p>Your goals will change. Your values will change. Avoid decisions that are so extreme they leave no room for the person you’ll become.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">12. You Should Like Risk Because It Pays Off Over Time</h3>
<p>But be wary of ruinous risk that can knock you out of the game entirely. The goal is to stay in the game long enough to let probability work in your favor.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">13. Define the Game You’re Playing</h3>
<p>Don’t take financial cues from people playing a different game. A day trader and a retirement saver have nothing to learn from each other.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">14. Respect the Mess</h3>
<p>Smart, reasonable people can disagree about money because they have different goals, experiences, and circumstances. There’s no single right answer.</p>

"Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people."
<cite>— The Psychology of Money, Chapter 19</cite>
