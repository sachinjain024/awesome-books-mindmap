            <h2>About This Book</h2>
<p>This mind map distills Matt Mochary’s practical playbook for startup CEOs and leaders. The book offers tactical, repeatable systems for one-on-ones, feedback, OKRs, meetings, hiring, firing, and communication—drawn from Mochary’s experience coaching hundreds of Silicon Valley founders.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a first-time CEO or scaling a team, these chapters give you the operating system to run your company effectively. From the foundation of 1:1s and feedback to execution through OKRs and meetings, from people systems for hiring and culture to strategy and governance, Mochary provides concrete playbooks you can implement immediately.</p>
<p>The book’s genius is its practicality: every chapter offers specific templates, scripts, and step-by-step processes you can adopt tomorrow.</p>

            <h3>Core Stoic Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>1:1s are non-negotiable:</strong> Regular, subordinate-led one-on-ones are the primary lever for alignment, feedback, and growth.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Feedback must be specific and timely:</strong> General praise or criticism doesn&#39;t change behavior; concrete examples do.</li>
                
                <li><strong>OKRs align the organization:</strong> Clear objectives and measurable key results keep everyone rowing in the same direction.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Write to scale:</strong> Written communication scales; spoken communication doesn&#39;t. Use memos and updates to inform at scale.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Hire slow, fire fast:</strong> Raise the bar for hiring and act decisively when someone isn&#39;t working out.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Culture is what you tolerate:</strong> Your values are defined by what you reward and what you let slide.</li>
                
                <li><strong>You are the bottleneck:</strong> The CEO&#39;s job is to remove themselves as the bottleneck by building systems and delegating.</li>
