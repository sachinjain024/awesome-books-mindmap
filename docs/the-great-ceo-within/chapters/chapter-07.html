        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 7: Hiring</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Three: People</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Hiring is one of the highest-leverage activities a CEO does. Get it wrong and you pay for months or years in misalignment, rework, or eventual firing. Get it right and the team compounds. This chapter covers how to define the bar, design the process, interview effectively, and make offers that attract the best.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Raise the Bar</h2>
            <p>Every hire either raises or lowers the average quality of the team. "Good enough" hires create a culture of "good enough." Define what great looks like for each role: skills, behaviors, and values. Be willing to leave a role open longer rather than fill it with someone who doesn't meet the bar. The cost of a bad hire—time, morale, rework—far exceeds the cost of waiting.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Hire slow, fire fast. Taking extra time to find the right person is cheaper than hiring the wrong person and having to fix it later.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Define the Role and the Bar</h2>
            <p>Before you post a job, get clear on: What outcomes will this person own? What skills and experience are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves? What behaviors and values are non-negotiable? Write a role doc or scorecard that the whole hiring team agrees on. Use it to screen and interview so you're evaluating against the same standard.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>Role Definition Checklist</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Outcomes and responsibilities (what they'll own)</li>
                    <li>Must-have skills and experience</li>
                    <li>Nice-to-have skills</li>
                    <li>Values and behaviors that fit your culture</li>
                    <li>What "great" looks like in 6–12 months</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Structured Interviewing</h2>
            <p>Unstructured interviews are biased and inconsistent. Use a structured process: same questions (or question types) for each candidate, with clear criteria for what good answers look like. Include role-specific exercises (e.g., a case, a take-home, or a work sample) to see how they think and work. Train interviewers to take notes and score against the bar so you can compare candidates fairly.</p>

            <div class="template-box">
                <h4>Interview Structure (example)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intro and background (5–10 min)</li>
                    <li>Behavioral questions (past behavior predicts future)</li>
                    <li>Role-specific or situational questions</li>
                    <li>Work sample or exercise if relevant</li>
                    <li>Candidate questions</li>
                    <li>Debrief with interviewers and calibrate</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Involve the Team</h2>
            <p>People who will work with the hire should be part of the process. They'll spot fit and skill issues that you might miss. Set a clear bar: we only hire if the team agrees this person raises the bar. "No" from one interviewer with good reasoning should carry weight. Avoid letting one person override the rest without discussion.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "If you wouldn't want to work for this person or have them on your team, don't hire them. The team's bar is as important as the CEO's."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Making the Offer</h2>
            <p>Move quickly once you've decided. Top candidates have options. Be clear on compensation, role, and growth. If you can't meet their number, say so and see if there's a creative solution (equity, role scope, timing). Sell the mission and the team—great people care about impact and who they'll work with. Close with a deadline so you don't lose them to a slow process.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Lowering the bar because you're desperate to fill the role. A mediocre hire will slow you down and eventually need to be replaced. Wait for the right person or change the role.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Define the bar for each role and don't hire below it; hire slow, fire fast.</li>
                <li>Write a clear role doc (outcomes, must-haves, values) and use it to evaluate consistently.</li>
                <li>Use structured interviews and work samples so you're comparing candidates fairly.</li>
                <li>Involve the team; only hire if they agree the person raises the bar.</li>
                <li>Move quickly on offers and sell the mission and team, not just the comp.</li>
