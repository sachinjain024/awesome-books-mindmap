        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 9: Company Culture and Values</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Three: People</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Culture is how people behave when no one is watching—and what you tolerate defines it as much as what you preach. Values are the principles you use to make decisions and evaluate people. This chapter covers how to define, live, and reinforce culture and values so they become a competitive advantage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Culture Actually Is</h2>
            <p>Culture isn't the poster on the wall. It's the set of behaviors that are rewarded, tolerated, or punished. If you say "we value transparency" but punish people who share bad news, your culture is "don't share bad news." If you say "we value ownership" but let people blame others, your culture is the opposite. Culture is what you do, not what you say.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Culture is what you tolerate. The behaviors you let slide—even once—signal what's really acceptable. To change culture, change what you reward and what you don't tolerate.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Defining Values</h2>
            <p>Values should be few (3–5), memorable, and actionable. They should describe behaviors you can recognize and evaluate. "Integrity" is vague; "We say what we think and do what we say" is something you can see. Involve the team in defining or refining values so they feel ownership. Use them in hiring (does this person embody our values?) and in performance discussions (where did they live the values, where did they not?).</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>Values That Work</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Few in number (3–5)</li>
                    <li>Stated as behaviors, not abstract nouns</li>
                    <li>Used in hiring and performance</li>
                    <li>Reinforced by leaders in words and actions</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Living the Values</h2>
            <p>You and the leadership team must model the values. If you don't, no one will believe them. Tell stories in all-hands or team meetings where someone lived a value—and be specific. When someone violates a value, address it; if you don't, you've just taught everyone that the value doesn't matter. Use values in 1:1s and reviews: "Here's where I saw you live [value]; here's where we need to do better."</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Your values are what you hire for, fire for, and promote for. If they're not part of those decisions, they're just words."

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Culture as a Filter</h2>
            <p>Use culture and values to make decisions: Does this candidate fit? Does this behavior align? Should we take this path? When in doubt, ask: "Is this who we want to be?" Culture doesn't mean everyone is the same—it means everyone shares a core set of expectations about how we work and treat each other.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Posting values and never using them. Values that don't show up in hiring, feedback, and promotions are wallpaper. Integrate them into every people process.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Culture is what you tolerate; it's defined by behaviors you reward or allow.</li>
                <li>Define 3–5 values as observable behaviors; involve the team so they own them.</li>
                <li>Leaders must model values; reinforce with stories and address violations.</li>
                <li>Use values in hiring, feedback, and promotions—otherwise they're just words.</li>
                <li>Use culture as a filter for decisions: "Is this who we want to be?"</li>
            </ul>
