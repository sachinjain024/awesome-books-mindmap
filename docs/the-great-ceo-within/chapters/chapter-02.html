        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: One-on-Ones (1:1s)</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part One: Foundation</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>One-on-ones are the most important meeting in your company. When done well, they drive alignment, surface problems early, build trust, and create space for feedback and growth. This chapter covers how to structure 1:1s, who owns the agenda, how often to run them, and what to discuss.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why 1:1s Matter</h2>
            <p>1:1s are the primary mechanism for you to understand what's really happening on the ground, for your reports to get your perspective, and for both of you to address issues before they become crises. They're also where feedback, career development, and prioritization get discussed. Skipping or deprioritizing them is one of the costliest mistakes a leader can make.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>If you could only do one type of meeting, it should be 1:1s. They have the highest leverage: they prevent misalignment, build relationships, and create a rhythm for feedback and growth.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Frequency and Duration</h2>
            <p>Mochary recommends weekly 1:1s with every direct report. Thirty minutes is often enough for most; fifty minutes once a week can work for senior reports or when there's a lot to cover. Consistency matters more than length—cancel rarely, and if you must, reschedule immediately.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>1:1 Cadence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Direct reports:</strong> Weekly, 30–50 minutes</li>
                    <li><strong>Skip-level (optional):</strong> Less frequent (e.g., biweekly or monthly) to stay connected to the broader team</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule:</strong> Don't cancel. Reschedule if necessary.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Who Owns the Agenda</h2>
            <p>The <strong>report owns the agenda</strong>, not the manager. Your job is to show up, listen, ask questions, and add your perspective. Their job is to bring topics: wins, challenges, decisions they need input on, feedback they want to give or get, and priorities. If they come with nothing, that's a topic in itself—why? Are they overwhelmed, under-engaged, or unclear on what to discuss?</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The subordinate should drive the 1:1. They bring the list. You're there to listen, clarify, and add your view—not to run through your own checklist."

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What to Cover</h2>
            <p>Typical 1:1 topics include: current priorities and progress, blockers, feedback (both ways), career and growth, and anything else the report wants to discuss. You can suggest a light structure (e.g., "What's top of mind? What do you need from me? Any feedback for me?") but keep it flexible so the conversation goes where it needs to go.</p>

            <div class="template-box">
                <h4>1:1 Topic Prompts (for the report)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are you working on? What's going well? What's stuck?</li>
                    <li>What do you need from me (decisions, input, resources)?</li>
                    <li>Is there any feedback you have for me?</li>
                    <li>Anything else you want to talk about?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Your Role as Manager</h2>
            <p>Listen more than you talk. Ask open-ended questions. Take notes so you remember commitments and follow up. Give feedback when relevant—and create safety so they can give you feedback too. If they're not bringing important issues to the table, ask why; sometimes it's trust, sometimes it's clarity on what "important" means.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Using 1:1s as status updates. Status can be shared async. Use the 1:1 for discussion, feedback, alignment, and relationship—things that require live conversation.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1:1s are the highest-leverage meeting: do them weekly with every direct report.</li>
                <li>The report owns the agenda; you listen, ask questions, and add your perspective.</li>
                <li>Cover priorities, blockers, feedback, and growth—keep structure light and flexible.</li>
                <li>Don't cancel; reschedule if you must. Consistency builds trust and habit.</li>
                <li>If your report has nothing to discuss, explore why—it may signal a bigger issue.</li>
            </ul>
