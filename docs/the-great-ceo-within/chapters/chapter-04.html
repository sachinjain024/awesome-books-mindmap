        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4: OKRs — Objectives and Key Results</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Two: Execution</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a framework for setting and tracking goals. An Objective is the qualitative goal; Key Results are the measurable outcomes that show you've achieved it. Used well, OKRs align the organization, create focus, and make progress visible without micromanagement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Are OKRs?</h2>
            <p>An <strong>Objective</strong> is a clear, inspiring goal (e.g., "Become the preferred choice for small businesses in our segment"). <strong>Key Results</strong> are 2–5 measurable outcomes that define success (e.g., "Achieve NPS of 50+," "Reach 10K active SMB customers"). Key Results should be measurable—usually a number—and verifiable. If you hit the Key Results, you've achieved the Objective.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>OKR Example</h4>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Ship a reliable, loved product that users recommend.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Results:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce P0 incidents to zero for 30 consecutive days</li>
                    <li>Achieve NPS of 40+ from enterprise segment</li>
                    <li>Ship 3 major features from the roadmap on time</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Use OKRs</h2>
            <p>OKRs create alignment: everyone can see how their work connects to company goals. They force prioritization—you can't have 20 objectives. They make progress visible so you can course-correct. And they separate "what we're committed to" (OKRs) from "what we'd like to do" (backlog), reducing confusion about what matters most.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>OKRs are not a performance evaluation tool. They're a planning and alignment tool. If you tie OKR achievement directly to bonus or rating, people will sandbag or game the numbers. Use OKRs to align and track; use other mechanisms to evaluate performance.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Cascading and Cadence</h2>
            <p>Company OKRs flow down: the company has 3–5 objectives with key results; each team has OKRs that support those. Individual OKRs (optional) support team OKRs. Cadence is typically quarterly: set OKRs at the start of the quarter, review progress weekly or in 1:1s, and score at the end. Some teams also set annual OKRs for longer-term direction.</p>

            <div class="template-box">
                <h4>OKR Cadence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quarter start:</strong> Set company OKRs, then team OKRs that roll up</li>
                    <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Check progress in team meetings or 1:1s</li>
                    <li><strong>Quarter end:</strong> Score key results (e.g., 0–1.0), reflect, set next quarter</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Writing Good Key Results</h2>
            <p>Key Results should be specific, measurable, and time-bound. "Improve customer satisfaction" is vague; "Achieve CSAT score of 4.2+ by end of Q2" is a key result. Avoid key results that are activities ("Launch 5 campaigns") unless the outcome is hard to measure; prefer outcomes ("Generate 500 qualified leads from campaigns").</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "If it doesn't have a number, it's not a Key Result. If you can't measure it, you can't manage it."

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Scoring and Stretch</h2>
            <p>At quarter end, score each key result (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 = 100% achieved). Many companies aim for 0.6–0.7 on average—if you're always at 1.0, your OKRs may be too easy. Stretch goals push the team; just don't make them the basis for punishment. Use scores to learn and set better OKRs next quarter.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Setting too many OKRs. Focus beats sprawl. 3–5 objectives per company, 2–4 key results per objective. More than that and nothing gets the attention it deserves.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Objectives are qualitative goals; Key Results are measurable outcomes (usually with a number).</li>
                <li>Use OKRs for alignment and focus, not as the sole basis for performance evaluation.</li>
                <li>Cascade from company → team (and optionally individual); review weekly, set quarterly.</li>
                <li>Write key results that are specific, measurable, and outcome-focused.</li>
                <li>Keep the list short: 3–5 objectives, 2–4 key results per objective.</li>
            </ul>
