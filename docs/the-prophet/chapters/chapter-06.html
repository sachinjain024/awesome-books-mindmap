            <p>Almustafa speaks on prayer as the expansion of the self into the living ether, and on beauty as life unveiling her holy face. Then he boards his ship and sails away—but his words remain with the people.</p>
<h2>On Prayer</h2>
<p>You pray in your distress and in your need; would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy and in the days of abundance. Prayer is not asking—it is the expansion of yourself into the living ether. When you pray you rise to meet in the air those who are praying at that very hour—and whom you cannot hear except in the prayer itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Beauty is life when life unveils her holy face. But you are life and you are the veil. Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror. But you are eternity and you are the mirror.&quot;
— Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>On Beauty</h2>
<p>Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. It is life unveiling her holy face—and you are both life and the veil. You are eternity and the mirror in which eternity gazes at itself. To seek beauty is to seek the depth of your own being.</p>
<h2>The Farewell</h2>
<p>Almustafa boards his ship. The people weep. He tells them: a little while, and my longing shall gather dust and foam for another body. A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me. He blesses them and sails. Almitra remains in silence—the teaching is complete, the Prophet has given all.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prayer is the expansion of the self into the living ether—not only asking</li>
<li>Beauty is life unveiling; you are both the veil and the mirror</li>
<li>The Prophet leaves, but the teaching remains in the hearts of those who listened</li>
</ul>
