        <div class="chapter-meta">Practice Three</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The effective executive builds on strength—their own, their colleagues', and their superiors'. They don't focus on weakness. Results come from exploiting strengths, not from shoring up weaknesses to mediocrity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Staff for Strength</h2>
            <p>The effective executive staffs for strength. They ask "What can this person do?" not "What can't they do?" Staffing to minimize weakness produces mediocrity.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The effective executive makes strength productive. He knows that one cannot build on weakness. To achieve results, one has to use all the available strengths."
                <div class="attribution">— Peter Drucker</div>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Lincoln's Lesson</h4>
                <p>When told that General Grant drank too much, Lincoln replied: "I wish I knew his brand. I'd send a barrel to my other generals." Grant's strength—he won battles—mattered more than his weakness.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Myth of the "Well-Rounded" Person</h2>
            <p>Organizations that demand "well-rounded" people with no major weaknesses end up with mediocrity. Strong people have strong weaknesses.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Weakness Trap</h4>
                <p>You cannot hire a "hand"—you get the whole person. The person who has no weaknesses is likely to have no strengths either. Average performance comes from average people.</p>

            <h2>Making Your Boss Productive</h2>
            <p>Effective executives also make their bosses' strengths productive. The boss is a reality—part of your job is to enable their effectiveness.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Managing Up</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand your boss's strengths and work style</li>
                    <li>Present information the way they can absorb it</li>
                    <li>Make them look good at what they do well</li>
                    <li>Don't expect them to change their weaknesses</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Making Your Own Strengths Productive</h2>
            <p>The same principle applies to yourself. Know your strengths and position yourself where they can produce results.</p>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>Self-Assessment Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>What have I done well? What work comes easily to me?</li>
                    <li>What do I do that others find difficult?</li>
                    <li>Where can I make the greatest contribution?</li>
                    <li>What are my limitations that I should work around?</li>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Designing Jobs for Strength</h2>
            <p>Jobs should be designed to bring out strengths, not to overcome weaknesses. A job that has defeated two or three people in succession is poorly designed.</p>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Job Design Principles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jobs should be demanding—they should challenge</li>
                    <li>Jobs should be big enough to allow growth</li>
                    <li>Jobs should focus on one major strength</li>
                    <li>Restructure jobs that defeat good people</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Staff for strength, not absence of weakness</li>
                <li>Strong people have strong weaknesses—accept this</li>
                <li>"Well-rounded" hiring produces mediocre teams</li>
                <li>Make your boss's strengths productive, not your frustrations</li>
                <li>Know your own strengths and position yourself to use them</li>
                <li>If a job defeats multiple people, redesign the job</li>
            </ul>
