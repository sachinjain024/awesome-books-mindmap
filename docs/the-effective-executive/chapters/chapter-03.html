        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: What Can I Contribute?</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Practice Two</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The effective executive focuses on contribution—on outward results rather than inward effort. They ask "What can I contribute that will significantly affect the performance of the organization?" This focus on contribution is the key to effectiveness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Focus on Contribution</h2>
            <p>Most people focus downward—on effort rather than results, on their work rather than its purpose. Effective executives focus outward—on what they can contribute.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The great majority of executives tend to focus downward. They are occupied with efforts rather than with results. They worry over what the organization and their superiors 'owe' them."
                <div class="attribution">— Peter Drucker</div>
            </div>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>The Central Question</h4>
                <p>"What can I contribute that will significantly affect the performance and results of the institution I serve?"</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Three Areas of Contribution</h2>
            <p>Drucker identifies three types of contribution every organization needs:</p>

            <div class="practices-grid">
                <div class="practice-card">
                    <h5>Direct Results</h5>
                    <p>The immediate outputs of your work</p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-card">
                    <h5>Building Values</h5>
                    <p>Reinforcing the organization's commitments</p>
                </div>
                <div class="practice-card">
                    <h5>Developing People</h5>
                    <p>Building tomorrow's human resources</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>An executive who focuses only on direct results neglects the organization's future. All three areas matter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>From Effort to Results</h2>
            <p>The shift from "What do I do?" to "What can I contribute?" transforms how you think about your role:</p>

                <h4>Effort vs. Contribution Focus</h4>

                        <h5>Effort Focus</h5>
                        <ul>

            <h2>Making Specialists Effective</h2>
            <p>Specialists—experts in narrow fields—face a particular challenge. Their knowledge is useless unless it can be integrated with the knowledge of others.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>The Specialist's Dilemma</h4>
                <p>The specialist must ask: "Who has to use my output for it to become effective? What do they need to know from me? What do I need to know from them?"</p>
            </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Right Human Relations</h2>
            <p>Focusing on contribution naturally creates good human relations. When you focus on what you can give rather than what you can get, relationships improve.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Four Requirements of Effective Relations</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Contribution-focused people think about what others need from them</li>
                    <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> "Who needs my output?" creates natural cooperation</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-development:</strong> You grow when you ask what you can contribute</li>
                    <li><strong>Development of others:</strong> Setting contribution standards helps others grow</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                <li>Focus outward on contribution, not inward on effort</li>
                <li>Ask: "What can I contribute that significantly affects results?"</li>
                <li>Three contribution areas: direct results, building values, developing people</li>
                <li>Specialists must translate their knowledge into others' needs</li>
