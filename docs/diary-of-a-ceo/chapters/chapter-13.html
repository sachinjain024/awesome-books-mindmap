<p>“The ceiling on your dreams determines the ceiling on your results. Shoot higher.”
— Steven Bartlett</p>

<h2>Psychology Before Strategy</h2>
<p>Most people approach ambitious goals by starting with the plan: market analysis, resource requirements, timelines, and risk assessments. Bartlett argues this is the wrong starting sequence.</p>
<p>Before you plan, you must first expand your sense of what is possible. Before strategy, you need psychology. Before the roadmap, you need a destination that genuinely fires your imagination — something so compelling that the obstacles between here and there become logistical details rather than fundamental limits.</p>
<p>A “psychological moonshot” is an aspiration so large that it changes the way you think about what’s achievable. When Kennedy announced the US would land on the moon within a decade, the technology to do it didn’t exist. But the aspiration organised enormous resources, talent, and creativity in service of a goal the old constraints said was impossible.</p>
<div class="insight-box">
<h4>The Peak-End Rule</h4>
<p>Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman's peak-end rule shows that people's memory of an experience is shaped primarily by two moments: the peak (the most intense point) and the end. This means small improvements to these two moments yield disproportionate returns in how an experience is remembered and valued. The same logic applies to stories: engineer the emotional peaks deliberately.</p>
</div>
<h2>Why Small Thinking Is Expensive</h2>
<p>Counterintuitively, setting modest, “realistic” goals is often more expensive than setting outrageous ones. Here’s why:</p>
<p>The effort required to achieve a 10x goal is often not 10 times greater than the effort required to achieve a 2x goal. The path to 10x forces you to think fundamentally differently — to question assumptions, find leverage, and discover approaches that 2x thinking would never identify.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 2x goal keeps you on the existing path, working harder within the existing constraints. You achieve the modest goal and discover you’ve spent the same energy for a fraction of the return.</p>
<p>Moonshot thinking breaks the existing constraints and forces the discovery of new paths.</p>
<div class="law-box">
<h4>The Core Law</h4>
<p>Expand your psychology before you develop your strategy. The ceiling on your belief determines the ceiling on your results. Shoot the psychological moonshot first — then plan backward from the impossible destination.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to Engineer Your Moonshot Thinking</h2>
<p><strong>Immerse in examples of radical achievement.</strong> The more you encounter people who have achieved what seems impossible, the more your brain recalibrates its sense of what is realistic. Spend time in the company of people who have achieved more than you currently believe is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Ask the 10x question.</strong> Not “How can I improve this by 20%?” but “How could this be 10 times better or bigger?” The question itself forces different thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Study the moments of peak experience.</strong> When have you felt most alive, most engaged, most energised? These moments are clues about what kind of moonshot would genuinely ignite your psychology rather than just sound impressive on paper.</p>
<div class="practice-box">
<h4>The Moonshot Exercise</h4>
<p>Take your current biggest goal and run it through this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write out your current goal as specifically as possible</li>
<li>Ask: "What would this look like if it were 10 times larger?"</li>
<li>Notice your initial emotional response — do you feel excitement (right direction) or just anxiety (scale without resonance)?</li>
<li>Identify one person who has already achieved something close to the 10x version</li>
<li>Study how they thought about it — what constraints did they ignore that you're assuming are fixed?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>The Psychology of Peak Moments</h2>
<p>Beyond personal goals, the peak-end rule has powerful implications for how you design customer experiences, team cultures, and communication. If people remember peaks and endings, design these deliberately. The beginning of an experience, the middle of a product journey, the midpoint of a presentation — these matter far less than the moment of greatest intensity and the final impression.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Psychology must be expanded before strategy is developed — the ceiling on belief determines the ceiling on results</li>
<li>Psychological moonshots are aspirations so large they fundamentally change how you think about what is achievable</li>
<li>Small thinking is often more expensive than moonshot thinking — 10x goals force different approaches that 2x goals never discover</li>
<li>Immerse in examples of radical achievement to recalibrate your sense of what is realistic</li>
<li>The peak-end rule means designing the most intense moments and the ending of any experience yields disproportionate returns</li>
</ul>
