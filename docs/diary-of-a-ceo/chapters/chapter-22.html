<p>“Having a Plan B is planning to fail. Burn the boats.”
— Steven Bartlett</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Psychology of Backup Plans</h2>
<p>Conventional wisdom treats backup plans as responsible risk management. Have a Plan B. Keep your options open. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. This advice is appropriate in many contexts — investing, safety planning, supply chain management.</p>
<p>But Bartlett identifies a critical domain where it is catastrophically wrong: <strong>personal ambition and creative commitment.</strong></p>
<p>When you create a backup plan for a deeply desired goal, you do something dangerous at the psychological level: you signal to your own brain that you anticipate failure. The backup plan is not just an option — it is an expression of incomplete confidence in the primary path. And incomplete confidence changes your behaviour in ways so subtle you often don’t notice.</p>
<div class="insight-box">
<h4>The Cortez Principle</h4>
<p>When Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortéz landed in Mexico in 1519, he famously ordered his ships burned. The message to his men was unambiguous: there is no going back. Conquest is the only option. The legend illustrates the psychological power of removing retreat as a possibility — it concentrates all psychological and physical resources on the only available path. This is Plan-A thinking in its most extreme form.</p>
</div>
<h2>How Backup Plans Undermine Primary Plans</h2>
<p>The research on goal commitment shows that when alternatives are available, people invest less effort in pursuing their primary goal. This is not laziness — it is a rational response to reduced stakes. If you can fall back on Plan B, the cost of not succeeding at Plan A is lower. And lower stakes produce lower effort, lower creativity, and lower resourcefulness.</p>
<p>Conversely, when retreat is truly not an option, the brain mobilises its full capacity. Problem-solving becomes more creative. Obstacles that would have been treated as reasons to consider the backup plan instead become challenges that must be overcome.</p>
<div class="law-box">
<h4>The Core Law</h4>
<p>For your most important goals and commitments, become a Plan-A thinker. Remove the psychological safety net and force yourself to find the solutions that only commitment without alternatives generates.</p>
</div>
<h2>What Plan-A Thinking Actually Requires</h2>
<p>This is not recklessness. Bartlett is not advocating ignoring risk or failing to plan for contingencies in operational contexts. Plan-A thinking is a psychological posture — a commitment to a primary path so complete that the brain treats it as the only option.</p>
<p>In practice, this looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Making public commitments</strong> that create accountability and social pressure to follow through</li>
<li><strong>Closing off easy exits</strong> from relationships, projects, or careers where the exit ramp is reducing investment</li>
<li><strong>Aligning identity with the goal</strong> — “I am someone who does X” rather than “I’m trying X to see if it works”</li>
<li><strong>Setting irreversible milestones</strong> — investments of time, money, or reputation that make turning back genuinely costly</li>
</ul>
<div class="practice-box">
<h4>The Commitment Test</h4>
<p>For your most important current goal, honestly assess:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have a backup plan? If yes, is it serving as a safety net that reduces your commitment to the primary goal?</li>
<li>Have you made a public commitment that makes failure genuinely costly?</li>
<li>On a 1-10 scale, how completely is your behaviour aligned with believing this goal will succeed?</li>
<li>What one action would most credibly demonstrate Plan-A commitment to yourself and others?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>The Paradox of Commitment</h2>
<p>The paradox of Plan-A thinking: the deeper your commitment to a single path, the more resources — creative, psychological, relational — you bring to bear on it, which ironically makes success more likely. The very inflexibility that seems like a risk is what generates the resourcefulness that reduces the risk.</p>
<p>This is why the most successful people often seem unreasonably committed to the point of obsession. The obsession is not a personality trait — it is a strategic choice that generates the level of engagement necessary for extraordinary outcomes.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Backup plans signal anticipated failure and reduce psychological commitment to the primary goal</li>
<li>Lower commitment produces lower effort, lower creativity, and lower resourcefulness — not responsible caution</li>
<li>Burning the boats — removing retreat as an option — concentrates all available resources on the primary path</li>
<li>Plan-A thinking is a psychological posture, not the absence of operational planning</li>
<li>The paradox: deeper commitment to a single path generates the resourcefulness that makes that path more likely to succeed</li>
</ul>
