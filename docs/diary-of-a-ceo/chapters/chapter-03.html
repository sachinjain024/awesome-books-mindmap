<p>“You and I are on the same side. The problem is our shared enemy.”
— Steven Bartlett</p>

<h2>The Disagreement Trap</h2>
<p>Most people think effective communication means stating your position clearly and defending it against opposing views. Steven Bartlett argues this is exactly wrong — and that reflexive disagreement is one of the most costly habits a leader or communicator can have.</p>
<p>The moment you open with “No,” “But,” or “However,” you trigger a psychological response in the other person that makes genuine communication nearly impossible. Disagreement activates the brain’s threat response. The other person stops listening to understand and starts listening to defend. You have turned a conversation into a battle.</p>
<div class="insight-box">
<h4>The Neuroscience of Opposition</h4>
<p>When someone feels attacked or contradicted, their amygdala fires — the primitive fight-or-flight centre. In this state, complex reasoning shuts down. You are no longer talking to a rational person; you are talking to a defended ego. Nothing you say will land.</p>
</div>
<h2>Strategic Agreement — The Alternative</h2>
<p>Bartlett’s principle is not that you should be dishonest or never push back. It is that <strong>how</strong> you enter a disagreement determines whether the conversation has any chance of changing minds — including yours.</p>
<p>The strategic alternative:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find genuine agreement first.</strong> There is almost always something you can honestly agree with. Start there.</li>
<li><strong>Validate their perspective.</strong> “I can see why you’d think that, given…” This doesn’t mean you agree — it means you’ve acknowledged their reasoning is not absurd.</li>
<li><strong>Ask questions instead of making counter-claims.</strong> “Help me understand…” or “What would change your mind about this?” invites exploration rather than entrenching positions.</li>
<li><strong>Position yourself alongside them against the problem.</strong> “We both want X — let’s figure out together why Y might or might not get us there.”</li>
</ol>
<div class="law-box">
<h4>The Core Law</h4>
<p>Never open with opposition. Enter every disagreement as an ally, not an adversary. Find agreement, validate perspective, then explore together.</p>
</div>
<h2>The “Tell Me More” Superpower</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful tools in Bartlett’s communication arsenal is deceptively simple: <strong>“Tell me more about that.”</strong></p>
<p>These four words accomplish several things simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li>They signal genuine curiosity and respect</li>
<li>They give the other person space to fully express their view</li>
<li>They often reveal that the disagreement was smaller than it appeared</li>
<li>They occasionally reveal that <em>you</em> were the one who was wrong</li>
</ul>
<p>The willingness to hear someone out fully before responding is rare and immediately differentiating. People who feel genuinely heard are infinitely more open to changing their minds.</p>
<div class="practice-box">
<h4>The 24-Hour Challenge</h4>
<p>For one full day, notice every time you are about to say "No," "But," or "However" in a conversation or meeting. Each time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pause and ask: "What can I honestly agree with here?"</li>
<li>Start with that agreement or with a clarifying question</li>
<li>Only after understanding fully, introduce your alternative perspective</li>
<li>Notice how the conversation changes</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Application in Leadership</h2>
<p>For leaders, this law is especially critical. When you reflexively disagree with your team’s ideas, you don’t just lose that argument — you train your team to stop bringing you ideas. The culture becomes one where people only propose what they believe will be approved, and genuine innovation dies.</p>
<p>Leaders who master strategic agreement create psychological safety. People bring them their best thinking because they know it will be heard before it is judged. This is how you access the full intelligence of your team.</p>

<h4>The Negotiator's Technique</h4>
<p>FBI hostage negotiators are trained never to open with opposition. Their entire philosophy is built around building rapport and finding agreement before any movement toward resolution. The principles transfer perfectly to boardrooms, sales calls, and difficult conversations.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Opening with “No,” “But,” or “However” triggers a defensive response that ends genuine communication</li>
<li>Strategic agreement is not dishonesty — it is the intelligent prerequisite to changing minds</li>
<li>“Tell me more about that” is one of the most powerful phrases in human communication</li>
<li>Find genuine points of agreement before introducing alternative perspectives</li>
<li>Leaders who reflexively disagree kill psychological safety and lose access to their team’s best ideas</li>
</ul>
