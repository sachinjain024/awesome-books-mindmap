<p>“The same idea, presented in different frames, can inspire or repel. Context is everything.”

<h2>What Is Framing?</h2>
<p>Framing is the context, language, and presentation within which information is delivered. It is the invisible architecture that shapes how a message is received before its content is even processed.</p>
<p>Two statements can contain identical information but produce completely different responses based entirely on their framing:</p>
<ul>
<li>“This surgery has a 10% failure rate” vs. “This surgery has a 90% success rate”</li>
<li>“This investment has returned 7% annually over 20 years” vs. “This investment doubled in value twice in 20 years”</li>
<li>“You’ll need to cut 30% of your budget” vs. “You have an opportunity to reallocate 30% of resources to higher-impact areas”</li>
</ul>
<p>The content is the same. The frame changes everything.</p>
<div class="insight-box">
<h4>The Nobel Prize-Winning Research</h4>
<p>Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's landmark research on cognitive biases demonstrated that people's decisions are profoundly influenced by how options are framed — even when the underlying information is identical. Their "Asian Disease Problem" showed that the same policy choice was supported by the majority when framed as saving lives and rejected by the majority when framed as losing lives. The frame, not the content, determined the outcome.</p>
</div>
<h2>The Master Lever of Persuasion</h2>
<p>Most people trying to persuade — whether selling, pitching, leading, or communicating — focus relentlessly on the content of their argument. What are the facts? What are the benefits? What is the evidence?</p>
<p>Bartlett argues that the frame is the master lever. The same facts, same benefits, same evidence, delivered in the wrong frame, will fail. The same facts in the right frame will persuade. Mastering framing is mastering influence.</p>
<p>Key framing dimensions to control:</p>
<p><strong>Gain vs. loss:</strong> People are twice as motivated by avoiding loss as they are by achieving gain. Frame changes in terms of what is at risk, not just what is available.</p>
<p><strong>Before vs. after:</strong> Experiences and products land differently when the before state is made vividly real first. The contrast between where someone is and where they could be is more powerful than the destination alone.</p>
<p><strong>The reference point:</strong> What you compare something to shapes its perceived value completely. A £500 bottle of wine next to a £50 bottle seems expensive. Next to a £2,000 bottle, it seems reasonable.</p>
<div class="law-box">
<h4>The Core Law</h4>
<p>The frame you choose for your idea, product, or message shapes its reception more powerfully than its content. Invest as much effort in how you present something as in what you present.</p>
</div>
<h2>Framing in Leadership</h2>
<p>For leaders, framing is a critical daily tool. The same challenge presented as a crisis vs. an opportunity produces completely different responses in teams. “We’re failing at X” vs. “We have a clear opportunity to improve X” mobilises different energy.</p>
<p>This is not about dishonesty. The same reality can be truthfully framed in many different ways. The leader’s job is to choose the frame that generates the most useful response.</p>
<div class="practice-box">
<h4>The Reframe Exercise</h4>
<p>Take one message, idea, or challenge you need to communicate. Write out three different frames for it:</p>
<ol>
<li>The default frame you would normally use</li>
<li>A loss-focused frame (what is at risk if this doesn't happen?)</li>
<li>An opportunity-focused frame (what becomes possible if this works?)</li>
<li>Test each with someone and notice the difference in their emotional response</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Framing in Marketing and Sales</h2>
<p>Every brand is a frame. The choice of name, logo, language, design, price point, distribution channel, and spokesperson all frame the product before a single benefit is communicated. The product that is identical to its competitor but framed as premium, exclusive, and curated will command dramatically higher prices and loyalty.</p>
<p>The most successful marketers don’t just communicate facts — they construct the frame within which those facts will be interpreted.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Framing is the invisible architecture that shapes how information is received before its content is processed</li>
<li>Kahneman and Tversky’s research shows that identical information produces different decisions based on framing alone</li>
<li>Loss framing is roughly twice as motivating as gain framing for most decisions</li>
<li>The reference point — what something is compared to — shapes perceived value completely</li>
<li>Leaders, marketers, and communicators should invest as much effort in framing as in content development</li>
</ul>
