<p>“The team that experiments the most, wins. The team that experiments the most will also fail the most — and that’s the point.”
— Steven Bartlett</p>

<h2>Rethinking Failure</h2>
<p>Most organisational cultures treat failure as something to be minimised, hidden, and apologised for. Performance reviews penalise failed projects. Post-mortems focus on blame. Leaders are rewarded for delivering certainty and punished for experiments that didn’t work.</p>
<p>This failure-averse culture is one of the most expensive mistakes a company can make. It doesn’t eliminate failure — it makes failure invisible until it’s catastrophic. It doesn’t create certainty — it destroys the learning that would reveal where certainty is actually achievable.</p>
<p>Steven Bartlett’s counterintuitive argument: the goal is not to fail less. It is to fail more — faster, smarter, and more publicly.</p>
<div class="insight-box">
<h4>The Innovation Mathematics</h4>
<p>If your probability of success on any given experiment is 10%, you need to run 10 experiments to expect one success. If a competitor runs experiments at twice your rate, they will reach that success at half your cost and timeline. The team that experiments more wins — not because they are smarter or luckier, but because they process more attempts. Failure rate is irrelevant. Attempt rate is everything.</p>
</div>
<h2>The 51% Decision Rule</h2>
<p>Bartlett describes a practical heuristic for deciding when to launch an experiment: the 51% threshold. You don’t need certainty. You don’t need a majority of evidence. You need to reach the point where the probability of success exceeds the probability of failure — even slightly.</p>
<p>At 51%, you launch. You gather real-world data. You iterate. The remaining 49% of uncertainty doesn’t disappear by waiting — it only disappears through doing.</p>
<p>Most organisations wait for 80% or 90% certainty before acting. By the time they reach that threshold (if ever), competitors who operated at 51% have already moved through five iterations.</p>
<div class="law-box">
<h4>The Core Law</h4>
<p>Out-fail your competition. Run more experiments, accept more failures, and share what you learn from both. The rate of learning — not the rate of success — is the primary competitive advantage in fast-moving environments.</p>
</div>
<h2>Creating a Failure-Positive Culture</h2>
<p>Building an organisation that genuinely embraces failure is harder than it sounds, because it requires actively rewiring deeply held assumptions about what failure means.</p>
<p><strong>Practices for failure-positive culture:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Celebrate intelligent failures:</strong> Publicly acknowledge and reward experiments that were well-designed, generated learning, and failed for the right reasons</li>
<li><strong>Share failure data:</strong> Post-mortems that surface what was learned — not who was responsible — create organisational learning</li>
<li><strong>Separate experimentation from execution:</strong> Different risk tolerances are appropriate for experimental work and delivering existing commitments</li>
<li><strong>Model it from the top:</strong> Leaders who openly share their own failures signal to the organisation that failure is safe</li>
</ul>
<div class="practice-box">
<h4>The Experiment Inventory</h4>
<p>For your current business, project, or personal goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>How many experiments are you currently running simultaneously?</li>
<li>What is your current ratio of successful experiments to failed ones?</li>
<li>What is preventing you from running more experiments?</li>
<li>Choose one assumption you currently take as fixed — and design an experiment to test it</li>
<li>Define what "51% confidence" would look like before launching</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>The Failure Transparency Advantage</h2>
<p>Bartlett also makes the case for sharing failures publicly — counterintuitive for most leaders who fear that admitting failure will undermine credibility.</p>
<p>In practice, the opposite is often true. Leaders who share their failures authentically build deeper trust than those who present only successes. Audiences can relate to failure in a way they cannot relate to curated success. The willingness to be vulnerable about what didn’t work signals the confidence and integrity that real credibility requires.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Failure-averse cultures don’t eliminate failure — they make it invisible until it’s catastrophic</li>
<li>The goal is to fail faster and more intelligently, not to fail less</li>
<li>The 51% decision rule: once probability of success exceeds probability of failure, launch — don’t wait for certainty that can only come from doing</li>
<li>The team with the highest rate of experiments wins, because they process more attempts and accumulate learning faster</li>
<li>Sharing failures publicly builds deeper trust than curated success — vulnerability signals confidence, not weakness</li>
</ul>
