<p>“One person below the bar brings everyone’s performance to their level. Protect the bar ruthlessly.”

<h2>The Three Bars Framework</h2>
<p>Building great teams is one of the most difficult and most important challenges any leader faces. Steven Bartlett offers a simple but powerful framework: every team member must clear three distinct bars, and compromising on any one of them weakens the entire team.</p>
<p><strong>The Three Bars:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Ability Bar:</strong> Does this person have the raw skill and competence required for this role at the level needed?</li>
<li><strong>The Culture Bar:</strong> Do their values, behaviours, and ways of working align with the team’s culture and non-negotiables?</li>
<li><strong>The Ambition Bar:</strong> Do they share the drive, hunger, and mission commitment that the team requires?</li>
</ol>
<div class="insight-box">
<h4>The Bad Apple Effect</h4>
<p>Research on team dynamics consistently shows that one low-performing or culture-violating team member has a disproportionate negative effect on the whole team. A single bad apple doesn't just fail to contribute — it actively drags down the performance of others around it, through reduced morale, lowered standards, and the distraction of managing the problem. The team average moves toward the outlier, not away from it.</p>
</div>
<h2>Why All Three Bars Matter</h2>
<p>Most hiring processes focus primarily on the Ability Bar — can this person do the job? Culture and ambition are often treated as secondary considerations, assessed less rigorously, or considered negotiable if the technical skills are strong enough.</p>
<p>This is a systematic error with predictable consequences.</p>
<p><strong>High ability, low culture fit:</strong> The technically excellent person who violates cultural norms — ignores values, treats colleagues poorly, operates by different rules — creates two problems for every one they solve. Their output is good; their effect on the team is corrosive.</p>
<p><strong>High ability, low ambition:</strong> The competent but disengaged person anchors the team to their level of drive. Their presence signals that reduced commitment is acceptable, gradually shifting the cultural norm downward.</p>
<p><strong>High culture, high ambition, low ability:</strong> The motivated culture fit who lacks the skills to execute creates kindness dilemmas — they deserve to be retained, but they are holding the team back.</p>
<div class="law-box">
<h4>The Core Law</h4>
<p>Treat all three bars as non-negotiable. When assessing team members — hiring or existing — ask: Do they clear the ability bar, the culture bar, and the ambition bar? Compromise on any single bar and you weaken the whole team.</p>
</div>
<h2>Applying the Three Bars in Practice</h2>
<p><strong>In hiring:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Design interview processes that specifically test all three dimensions</li>
<li>Give equal weight to culture and ambition assessment as to skills assessment</li>
<li>Make the culture bar explicit: what are the specific non-negotiable values and behaviours?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In ongoing team management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly assess current team members against all three bars</li>
<li>Have honest conversations when bars are not being cleared</li>
<li>Raise the bars as the team grows — what cleared the bar at founding may not clear it at scale</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In letting people go:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most common reason to part ways is a bar that is consistently not met despite feedback and support</li>
<li>Act decisively — the cost of delay compounds, for the individual and for the team</li>
</ul>
<div class="practice-box">
<h4>The Team Audit</h4>
<p>For each member of your current team, honestly assess on a scale of 1-10:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ability Bar:</strong> Does their output meet the standard the role requires?</li>
<li><strong>Culture Bar:</strong> Do their values and behaviours reflect your non-negotiables?</li>
<li><strong>Ambition Bar:</strong> Do they bring the drive and commitment the mission requires?</li>
<li>For anyone scoring below 7 on any dimension: is this a development opportunity or a fundamental mismatch?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>The Hiring Mistake Cost</h2>
<p>Bartlett emphasises that a bad hire is dramatically more expensive than most leaders calculate. Beyond the salary cost, a bad hire occupies a role that a great person could be in, requires management time and energy, affects team morale, and potentially requires significant investment in performance management and separation before the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>The cost of raising the hiring bar — spending more time, running more candidates, waiting longer for the right person — is almost always less than the cost of the wrong hire.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every team member must clear three bars: ability, culture, and ambition — compromise on any one weakens the whole team</li>
<li>The bad apple effect means one culture-violating or disengaged team member actively drags down those around them</li>
<li>High ability without culture or ambition creates problems for every solution it generates</li>
<li>Treat all three bars as non-negotiable in both hiring and ongoing team management</li>
<li>The true cost of a bad hire far exceeds the salary — it includes morale, management time, opportunity cost, and separation costs</li>
</ul>
