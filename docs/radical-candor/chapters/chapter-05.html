            <p>Not everyone wants to climb the corporate ladder. Some people want rapid career growth; others want to excel at what they do without taking on management. Both paths are valid, and great bosses understand what each person on their team wants.</p>
<h2>The Career Ladder Myth</h2>
<p>Organizations assume everyone wants to move “up.” But for many people, moving into management means doing less of what they love.</p>
<h3 class="warning-box">The Problem with “Up or Out”</h3>
<ul>
<li>Loses great individual contributors by forcing them into management</li>
<li>Creates bad managers (people who don’t want to manage)</li>
<li>Punishes people who want to stay excellent at their craft</li>
<li>Assumes ambition only means climbing the ladder</li>
<li>Ignores people’s actual motivations and strengths</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steep Growth Trajectory vs. Gradual Growth Trajectory</h2>
<p>Kim Scott proposes two valid career trajectories: people on a steep growth trajectory (ambitious for new challenges and promotions) and people on a gradual growth trajectory (ambitious for excellence in their current role).</p>
<h3 class="comparison-box">Two Valid Paths</h3>
<p><strong>Steep Growth Trajectory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wants rapid career progression</li>
<li>Seeks new challenges constantly</li>
<li>Willing to change roles, teams, or companies</li>
<li>Energized by learning new things</li>
<li>Thrives on increased responsibility</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Your role as boss:</em> Give stretch assignments, promotions, new challenges</p>
<p><strong>Gradual Growth Trajectory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wants to excel at current role</li>
<li>Values stability and mastery</li>
<li>Happy without constant change</li>
<li>May have priorities outside work (family, hobbies)</li>
<li>Not less ambitious—differently ambitious</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Your role as boss:</em> Honor their choice, give opportunities for mastery, protect from “up or out” pressure</p>
<h2>Trajectories Change</h2>
<p>People move between trajectories throughout their careers. Someone might be on a steep trajectory, then shift to gradual after having kids—then shift back years later. The key is staying in conversation.</p>
<h3 class="concept-box">Life Changes Career Trajectories</h3>
<p>Events that might shift someone’s trajectory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having children or caring for aging parents</li>
<li>Health issues or burnout recovery</li>
<li>Pursuing passion projects or education</li>
<li>Life stage transitions</li>
<li>Personal priorities shifting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not everyone wants to climb the corporate ladder</li>
<li>Steep growth trajectory: wants promotions and new challenges</li>
<li>Gradual growth trajectory: wants mastery and stability</li>
<li>Both paths are equally valid and valuable</li>
<li>People’s trajectories change throughout their careers</li>
<li>Your job is to understand what each person wants and support it</li>
</ul>
