        <div class="chapter-meta">Part 4: Drive Results Collaboratively</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Building a kick-ass team means hiring right, firing when necessary, promoting carefully, and making tough decisions about team composition. This chapter covers the hardest parts of management: people decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hiring: Don't Lower the Bar</h2>
            <p>When you're desperate to fill a role, it's tempting to hire someone "good enough." But one bad hire can damage team culture and morale for years.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Cost of a Bad Hire</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drags down team performance</li>
                    <li>Lowers the bar for future hires ("Well, we hired them...")</li>
                    <li>Demoralizes top performers</li>
                    <li>Forces you to spend time managing them out later</li>
                    <li>Signals you don't care about quality</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Hiring Standards</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Can they do the job?</li>
                    <li><strong>Trajectory:</strong> Are they learning and growing?</li>
                    <li><strong>Culture fit:</strong> Do they share your values? (Not "do I want to grab a beer with them")</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Will they make the team better?</li>
                    <li><strong>The sniff test:</strong> Are you genuinely excited to work with them?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you're unsure, the answer is no.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Firing: Don't Wait Too Long</h2>
            <p>Most managers wait too long to fire underperformers, hoping they'll improve. This harms the team, the person, and you.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>When to Fire Someone</h4>
                <p>Consider firing if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They're not meeting expectations despite clear feedback and support</li>
                    <li>They violate company values (respect, integrity, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Their presence is damaging team morale or performance</li>
                    <li>You've given them a fair chance to improve and they haven't</li>
                    <li>You're spending all your time managing them instead of the team</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="challenge-box">
                <h4>Before You Fire: The Three Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Have I given Radically Candid feedback?</strong> Have you been clear about the problem?</li>
                    <li><strong>Have I given them time and support to improve?</strong> Did they have a real chance?</li>
                    <li><strong>Is this about performance or fit?</strong> Maybe they're great but wrong for this role.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If you can answer yes to the first two and the issue persists, it's time to move on.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Promotions: Reward the Right Behaviors</h2>
            <p>Who you promote sends a signal about what you value. Promote someone who cuts corners, and you've told the team that's what matters.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>What to Reward with Promotions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Results:</strong> They deliver high-quality work consistently</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> They make the team better, not just themselves</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth:</strong> They're continuously learning and improving</li>
                    <li><strong>Values:</strong> They embody the behaviors you want to see</li>
                    <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Others look to them for guidance</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Don't promote based on:</strong> tenure alone, politics, or who complains the loudest.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Managing the "Brilliant Jerk"</h2>
            <p>The brilliant jerk delivers great work but treats people poorly. Many organizations tolerate this, but it's toxic.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Brilliant Jerk Problem</h4>
                <p>When you tolerate a brilliant jerk:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top performers leave (they won't tolerate toxicity)</li>
                    <li>Team morale plummets</li>
                    <li>You signal that results matter more than people</li>
                    <li>Others copy the behavior ("If they can act like that, so can I")</li>
                    <li>Your best people become your quietest (they disengage)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Give them Radically Candid feedback. If they don't change, let them go. Talent is not an excuse for cruelty.</p>

            <h2>Growing Your Team vs. Shrinking It</h2>
            <p>Sometimes you need to grow your team; sometimes you need to shrink it. Both decisions require Radical Candor.</p>

            <div class="comparison-box">

                            <li>Performance is inconsistent or declining</li>
                            <li>Team is bloated with politics</li>
                            <li>Budget constraints demand it</li>

                <p>Don't grow your team just because it feels like "success." Big teams are harder to manage and slower to move.</p>

            <h2>The "No Asshole Rule"</h2>
            <p>Stanford professor Bob Sutton coined the "No Asshole Rule"—don't hire or tolerate people who demean others. Kim Scott agrees: Radical Candor is about challenging people, not being cruel.</p>

            <div class="care-box">
                <h4>Radical Candor ≠ Being Mean</h4>
                <p>Radical Candor is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Telling someone their work isn't good enough and helping them improve</li>
                    <li>Giving hard feedback because you care about their success</li>
                    <li>Being direct and kind at the same time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Being an asshole is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Belittling people publicly</li>
                    <li>Giving feedback to humiliate, not to help</li>
                    <li>Disrespecting people as human beings</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If someone can't tell the difference, they don't belong on your team.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't lower the hiring bar—one bad hire damages the whole team</li>
                <li>Fire underperformers sooner than feels comfortable (after giving fair feedback)</li>
                <li>Promotions signal what you value—reward collaboration and values, not just results</li>
                <li>Don't tolerate brilliant jerks—talent isn't an excuse for cruelty</li>
                <li>Grow your team when needed, shrink when necessary—size isn't success</li>
                <li>Enforce the "No Asshole Rule"—Radical Candor is direct, not mean</li>
