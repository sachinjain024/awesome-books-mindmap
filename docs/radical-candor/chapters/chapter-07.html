<p>Building a kick-ass team means hiring right, firing when necessary, promoting carefully, and making tough decisions about team composition. This chapter covers the hardest parts of management: people decisions.</p>
<h2>Hiring: Don’t Lower the Bar</h2>
<p>When you’re desperate to fill a role, it’s tempting to hire someone “good enough.” But one bad hire can damage team culture and morale for years.</p>
<h3 class="warning-box">The Cost of a Bad Hire</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drags down team performance</li>
<li>Lowers the bar for future hires (“Well, we hired them…”)</li>
<li>Demoralizes top performers</li>
<li>Forces you to spend time managing them out later</li>
<li>Signals you don’t care about quality</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="principle-box">Hiring Standards</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Can they do the job?</li>
<li><strong>Trajectory:</strong> Are they learning and growing?</li>
<li><strong>Culture fit:</strong> Do they share your values? (Not “do I want to grab a beer with them”)</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Will they make the team better?</li>
<li><strong>The sniff test:</strong> Are you genuinely excited to work with them?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re unsure, the answer is no.</p>
<h2>Firing: Don’t Wait Too Long</h2>
<p>Most managers wait too long to fire underperformers, hoping they’ll improve. This harms the team, the person, and you.</p>
<h3 class="concept-box">When to Fire Someone</h3>
<p>Consider firing if:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’re not meeting expectations despite clear feedback and support</li>
<li>They violate company values (respect, integrity, etc.)</li>
<li>Their presence is damaging team morale or performance</li>
<li>You’ve given them a fair chance to improve and they haven’t</li>
<li>You’re spending all your time managing them instead of the team</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="challenge-box">Before You Fire: The Three Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Have I given Radically Candid feedback?</strong> Have you been clear about the problem?</li>
<li><strong>Have I given them time and support to improve?</strong> Did they have a real chance?</li>
<li><strong>Is this about performance or fit?</strong> Maybe they’re great but wrong for this role.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can answer yes to the first two and the issue persists, it’s time to move on.</p>
<h2>Promotions: Don’t Promote Too Fast</h2>
<p>Promoting someone before they’re ready sets them up to fail. Promoting the wrong person demoralizes the team.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t lower the hiring bar—one bad hire damages everything</li>
<li>Fire underperformers after giving clear feedback and fair chances</li>
<li>Retaining bad performers punishes good performers</li>
<li>Promote carefully—too fast or too slow both cause problems</li>
<li>The hardest decisions are people decisions, but they matter most</li>
</ul>
