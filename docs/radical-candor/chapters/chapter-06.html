        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 6: Collaborate</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part 4: Drive Results Collaboratively</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Getting stuff done collaboratively means avoiding two extremes: being a dictator (deciding everything alone) and being too hands-off (abdicating responsibility). This chapter introduces the "Get Stuff Done" wheel for driving results through collaboration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Get Stuff Done Wheel</h2>
            <p>Great bosses don't just decide or delegate. They create a collaborative process that generates better ideas and stronger buy-in.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>The Seven Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Listen:</strong> Create space for ideas to emerge</li>
                    <li><strong>Clarify:</strong> Sharpen the idea through questions and debate</li>
                    <li><strong>Debate:</strong> Explore perspectives and challenge assumptions</li>
                    <li><strong>Decide:</strong> Make a clear decision (don't let it drag on)</li>
                    <li><strong>Persuade:</strong> Explain the decision and bring skeptics along</li>
                    <li><strong>Execute:</strong> Get it done with clear ownership</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn:</strong> Reflect on results and feed back into listening</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Listen: Create a Culture of Listening</h2>
            <p>Most bosses listen poorly. They interrupt, finish people's sentences, or mentally prepare their response instead of actually hearing.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>How to Really Listen</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Give quiet time:</strong> Not everyone processes thoughts out loud. Give people time to think.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create listening tours:</strong> Regularly ask "What's on your mind?" with no agenda</li>
                    <li><strong>Hold office hours:</strong> Block time when anyone can drop by</li>
                    <li><strong>Skip the meeting:</strong> Walk around and have informal conversations</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen with your whole body:</strong> Put away devices, make eye contact, nod</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Clarify: Sharpen the Idea</h2>
            <p>Raw ideas are messy. Help people clarify by asking questions, not by taking over and "fixing" their idea.</p>

            <div class="challenge-box">
                <h4>Clarifying Questions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>"What problem are we solving?"</li>
                    <li>"Who is this for?"</li>
                    <li>"What would success look like?"</li>
                    <li>"What's the simplest version of this?"</li>
                    <li>"What are we assuming that might not be true?"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Debate: Explore Every Angle</h2>
            <p>Good debate is about finding truth, not winning arguments. Create a culture where people challenge ideas (not people) without fear.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Healthy Debate vs. Unhealthy Debate</h4>
                <p><strong>Healthy debate:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focuses on ideas, not egos</li>
                    <li>Everyone participates (not dominated by loudest voices)</li>
                    <li>People change their minds when presented with better arguments</li>
                    <li>Ends with stronger ideas</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Unhealthy debate:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal attacks or "winning" at all costs</li>
                    <li>Dominated by senior people or loud voices</li>
                    <li>People dig in and refuse to listen</li>
                    <li>Creates resentment and damaged relationships</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Decide: Make the Call</h2>
            <p>After listening, clarifying, and debating, someone needs to decide. Endless debate without decisions kills momentum.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Decision-Making Traps</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consensus addiction:</strong> Waiting for everyone to agree before deciding (it won't happen)</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision by committee:</strong> No one feels ownership, leading to mediocre compromises</li>
                    <li><strong>Too slow:</strong> Waiting too long for perfect information</li>
                    <li><strong>Ego-driven:</strong> Boss decides without input, undermining the whole process</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Be clear who decides (and when), but separate "who decides" from "who has input."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Persuade: Bring People Along</h2>
            <p>After the decision, you need to persuade people—especially those who disagreed. If people don't understand the "why," they won't execute well.</p>

            <div class="care-box">
                <h4>How to Persuade After a Decision</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Explain the why:</strong> What problem does this solve?</li>
                    <li><strong>Acknowledge dissent:</strong> "I know some of you disagree. Here's why we're moving forward anyway."</li>
                    <li><strong>Show you listened:</strong> "We considered X, Y, and Z. Here's why we chose A."</li>
                    <li><strong>Be credible:</strong> Use emotion AND logic (not just one)</li>
                    <li><strong>Show the data:</strong> If you have evidence, share it</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Execute: Get It Done</h2>
            <p>Execution requires clear ownership, timelines, and accountability. "We should do this" is not a plan.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Execution Essentials</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clear owner:</strong> One person owns the outcome (not a committee)</li>
                    <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> When will this be done? What are the milestones?</li>
                    <li><strong>Resources:</strong> What do they need to succeed?</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> How will we track progress?</li>
                    <li><strong>Remove blockers:</strong> Your job is to clear the path</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>7. Learn: Close the Loop</h2>
            <p>After execution, reflect on what worked and what didn't. Feed learnings back into the next round of listening.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Learning Questions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>"What went well? Why?"</li>
                    <li>"What didn't go as planned? Why?"</li>
                    <li>"What would we do differently next time?"</li>
                    <li>"What did we learn about our customers/users?"</li>
                    <li>"What assumptions were wrong?"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Celebrate wins AND failures (if you learned something valuable).</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
