<p>&quot;Your job as a leader is not to have all the answers. It's to create an environment where the best ideas surface and win.&quot;

<p>Getting stuff done collaboratively means avoiding two extremes: being a dictator (deciding everything alone) and being too hands-off (abdicating responsibility). This chapter introduces the &quot;Get Stuff Done&quot; wheel for driving results through collaboration.</p>
<h2>The Get Stuff Done Wheel</h2>
<p>Great bosses don't just decide or delegate. They create a collaborative process that generates better ideas and stronger buy-in.</p>
<h3>The Seven Steps {.concept-box}</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Listen:</strong> Create space for ideas to emerge</li>
<li><strong>Clarify:</strong> Sharpen the idea through questions and debate</li>
<li><strong>Debate:</strong> Explore perspectives and challenge assumptions</li>
<li><strong>Decide:</strong> Make a clear decision (don't let it drag on)</li>
<li><strong>Persuade:</strong> Explain the decision and bring skeptics along</li>
<li><strong>Execute:</strong> Get it done with clear ownership</li>
<li><strong>Learn:</strong> Reflect on results and feed back into listening</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. Listen: Create a Culture of Listening</h2>
<p>Most bosses listen poorly. They interrupt, finish people's sentences, or mentally prepare their response instead of actually hearing.</p>
<h3>How to Really Listen {.principle-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Give quiet time:</strong> Not everyone processes thoughts out loud. Give people time to think.</li>
<li><strong>Create listening tours:</strong> Regularly ask &quot;What's on your mind?&quot; with no agenda</li>
<li><strong>Hold office hours:</strong> Block time when anyone can drop by</li>
<li><strong>Skip the meeting:</strong> Walk around and have informal conversations</li>
<li><strong>Listen with your whole body:</strong> Put away devices, make eye contact, nod</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Clarify: Sharpen the Idea</h2>
<p>Raw ideas are messy. Help people clarify by asking questions, not by taking over and &quot;fixing&quot; their idea.</p>
<h3>Clarifying Questions {.challenge-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What problem are we solving?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Who is this for?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What would success look like?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What's the simplest version of this?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What are we assuming that might not be true?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Debate: Explore Every Angle</h2>
<p>Good debate is about finding truth, not winning arguments. Create a culture where people challenge ideas (not people) without fear.</p>
<h2>4. Decide: Don't Let It Drag On</h2>
<p>At some point, debate must end and someone must decide. As the leader, it's often you—but not always.</p>
<h2>5. Persuade: Bring People Along</h2>
<p>Once decided, explain the reasoning. Even those who disagreed need to understand why the decision was made.</p>
<h2>6. Execute: Clear Ownership</h2>
<p>Make sure someone owns the work. &quot;We'll all do it&quot; means no one does it.</p>
<h2>7. Learn: Close the Loop</h2>
<p>What worked? What didn't? Feed the learning back into listening.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Get Stuff Done wheel: Listen, Clarify, Debate, Decide, Persuade, Execute, Learn</li>
<li>Collaboration isn't abdication—you still make decisions</li>
<li>Great leaders create environments where the best ideas win</li>
<li>Each step is important; skipping steps creates problems</li>
<li>Close the loop by learning and feeding back into listening</li>
</ul>
