            <p>Most people dramatically under-praise. They save praise for big achievements and ignore the daily work that deserves recognition. Effective praise is specific, sincere, and immediate—and it's not optional.</p>
<h2>Why Praise Matters</h2>
<p>Praise isn't just &quot;nice to have&quot;—it's critical for learning and motivation. People need to know what they're doing well so they can do more of it.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of Praise {.care-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shows people what &quot;good&quot; looks like</li>
<li>Reinforces behaviors you want to see more of</li>
<li>Builds confidence and trust</li>
<li>Makes criticism easier to hear later</li>
<li>Prevents people from questioning their value</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be Specific</h2>
<p>Generic praise (&quot;great job!&quot;) is forgettable and ineffective. Specific praise tells people exactly what they did well.</p>
<h3>Generic vs. Specific Praise {.comparison-box}</h3>
<p><strong>Generic (Weak):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Nice work on the presentation!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;You're a great employee&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Keep it up!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Good job on the project&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific (Strong):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Your opening story grabbed everyone's attention—that's exactly how to start a pitch&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The way you debugged that issue by checking logs first saved us hours&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;You asked clarifying questions that prevented a major misunderstanding&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The documentation you wrote made onboarding the new hire seamless&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be Sincere</h2>
<p>People can detect fake praise instantly. If you don't mean it, don't say it. And never praise someone just to soften upcoming criticism.</p>
<h3>Avoid These Praise Mistakes {.warning-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The &quot;praise sandwich&quot;:</strong> Praise → Criticism → Praise (people see through this)</li>
<li><strong>Personality praise:</strong> &quot;You're so smart&quot; (focuses on identity, not actions)</li>
<li><strong>Insincere praise:</strong> Praising something mediocre just to be nice</li>
<li><strong>Public praise for private people:</strong> Know your audience</li>
<li><strong>Comparison praise:</strong> &quot;You're better than [colleague]&quot; (creates competition)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Praise Immediately and In Person</h2>
<p>Praise loses impact when delayed. Give it as soon as you notice something praise-worthy. And whenever possible, do it face-to-face.</p>
<h3>The HIP Principle (for Praise) {.principle-box}</h3>
<p>Make praise:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helpful:</strong> Tells them what to keep doing</li>
<li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Given right away, not weeks later</li>
<li><strong>In Person:</strong> Or at least via video call, not just Slack</li>
</ul>
<h2>Praise in Public (Usually)</h2>
<p>Most people appreciate public recognition, but know your team. Some people find public praise embarrassing.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most managers under-praise dramatically</li>
<li>Be specific: tell people exactly what they did well</li>
<li>Be sincere: fake praise is worse than no praise</li>
<li>Give praise immediately and in person when possible</li>
<li>Public praise works for most people, but know your audience</li>
<li>Praise is not optional—it's critical for growth</li>
</ul>
