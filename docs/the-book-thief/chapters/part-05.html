            <h3>Death Speaks {.death-narration}</h3>
<p>&quot;The mayor's wife had been waiting. Since the book burning, since she saw a girl with singed hands and stolen words, she had been waiting for the book thief to come to her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The window was left open deliberately. Ilsa Hermann may have been lost in grief, but she understood something about that girl: she needed books the way other people needed food.&quot;</p>
<h2>Rosa's Washing</h2>
<p>Rosa Hubermann takes in washing and ironing for wealthier families in Molching.</p>
<p>One of her customers is the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann.</p>
<p>It is Liesel's job to deliver and collect the laundry.</p>
<p>Liesel has never been invited inside—until now.</p>
<h3>Ilsa Hermann {.character-box}</h3>
<p><strong>The Mayor's Wife</strong></p>
<p>A woman frozen in grief. Her only son died in the first World War.</p>
<p>She leaves windows open even in winter. She barely speaks.</p>
<p>But she has one treasure: a library. Walls lined with books, floor to ceiling.</p>
<p>And she saw a girl at the burning, a girl hungry for words.</p>
<h2>The Library</h2>
<p>One day, Ilsa opens the door wider than usual.</p>
<p>Through the halls, up the stairs, to a room that stops Liesel's heart.</p>
<p>Books. Thousands of books. Shelves reaching toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>&quot;You can come here,&quot; Ilsa whispers. &quot;Whenever you like. You can read.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Whistler {.stolen-book}</h3>
<p>Liesel begins reading in the mayor's library. Her first choice is <strong>The Whistler</strong>.</p>
<p>A thriller about a murderer who whistles before he kills.</p>
<p>The library becomes Liesel's second basement.</p>
<h2>The Falling Out</h2>
<p>War is expensive. The mayor's household must cut costs.</p>
<p>Rosa Hubermann's washing service is terminated.</p>
<p>Liesel is furious—not about the washing, but about everything.</p>
<p>She returns to the mayor's house and screams at Ilsa.</p>
<h2>Through the Window</h2>
<p>After the argument, Liesel believes she can never return to the library.</p>
<p>But she cannot stay away from the books. So she finds another way.</p>
<p>The mayor's wife leaves a window open. Always. Even in winter.</p>
<p>Liesel climbs through and steals The Whistler.</p>
<p>Ilsa knows. The window is always open. The invitation never really ended.</p>
<h2>Rudy Joins the Theft</h2>
<p>Liesel cannot keep her secret from Rudy forever.</p>
<p>Soon he is climbing through the window with her.</p>
<p>Rudy is not interested in reading. He is interested in Liesel. In adventure.</p>
<p>He asks for a kiss as payment. She always says no.</p>
<h3>Books for Max {.hope-box}</h3>
<p>Liesel begins bringing her stolen books to the basement.</p>
<p>She reads to Max in the candlelight. She shares The Whistler with him.</p>
<p>Max, who painted over Mein Kampf, now receives real books.</p>
<p>Liesel steals for herself. But she also steals for him.</p>
