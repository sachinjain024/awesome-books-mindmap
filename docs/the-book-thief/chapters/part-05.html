        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Speaks</h4>
            <p>"The mayor's wife had been waiting. Since the book burning, since she saw a girl with singed hands and stolen words, she had been waiting for the book thief to come to her."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Rosa's Washing</h2>
            <p>Rosa Hubermann takes in washing and ironing for wealthier families in Molching. One of her customers is the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann. It is Liesel's job to deliver and collect the laundry.</p>
            <p>Liesel has been making these deliveries for months. She has seen the large house on Grande Strasse, climbed the steps to the front door, waited for the strange, sad woman to appear.</p>
            <p>But she has never been invited inside—until now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="character-box">
            <h4>Ilsa Hermann</h4>
            <div class="role">The Mayor's Wife</div>
            <p>A woman frozen in grief. Her only son died in the first World War, and she has never recovered. She leaves windows open even in winter. She barely speaks. She haunts her own house like a ghost.</p>
            <p>But she has one treasure: a library. Walls lined with books, floor to ceiling. And she saw a girl at the burning, a girl hungry for words.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Library</h2>
            <p>One day, Ilsa opens the door wider than usual. She gestures for Liesel to follow. Through the halls, up the stairs, to a room that stops Liesel's heart.</p>
            <p>Books. Thousands of books. Shelves reaching toward the ceiling. More words than Liesel has ever seen in one place.</p>
            <p>"You can come here," Ilsa whispers. "Whenever you like. You can read."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stolen-book">
            <h4>The Whistler</h4>
            <p>Liesel begins reading in the mayor's library. Her first choice is <strong>The Whistler</strong>—a thriller about a murderer who whistles before he kills. She reads a few pages each visit, standing in the cold room while Ilsa watches in silence.</p>
            <p>The library becomes Liesel's second basement. A place where words surround her like walls, protecting her from the world outside.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Falling Out</h2>
            <p>But war is expensive. The mayor's household must cut costs. Rosa Hubermann's washing service is terminated.</p>
            <p>Liesel is furious—not about the washing, but about everything. Her mother's poverty. Ilsa's frozen grief. The unfairness of a world where some have libraries and others have nothing.</p>
            <p>She returns to the mayor's house and screams at Ilsa. She calls her pathetic. She tells her she should be ashamed, living in the past while others suffer in the present.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Through the Window</h2>
            <p>After the argument, Liesel believes she can never return to the library. But she cannot stay away from the books. So she finds another way.</p>
            <p>The mayor's wife leaves a window open. Always. Even in winter. Liesel climbs through and steals The Whistler, page by page, then the entire book.</p>
            <p>Ilsa knows. The window is always open. The invitation never really ended.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Reflects</h4>
            <p>"The window was left open deliberately. Ilsa Hermann may have been lost in grief, but she understood something about that girl: she needed books the way other people needed food. The theft was a gift, freely given by leaving the latch undone."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Rudy Joins the Theft</h2>
            <p>Liesel cannot keep her secret from Rudy forever. Soon he is climbing through the window with her, watching the door while she selects her next book.</p>
            <p>Rudy is not interested in reading. He is interested in Liesel. In adventure. In being part of whatever she's doing. He asks for a kiss as payment.</p>
            <p>She always says no.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hope-box">
            <h4>Books for Max</h4>
            <p>Liesel begins bringing her stolen books to the basement. She reads to Max in the candlelight. She shares The Whistler with him, chapter by chapter.</p>
            <p>Max, who painted over Mein Kampf, now receives real books. Stories that have nothing to do with hate. Adventures that take him out of the basement, even if only in imagination.</p>
            <p>Liesel steals for herself. But she also steals for him.</p>
