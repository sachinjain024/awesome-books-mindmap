            <h4>Death Speaks</h4>
            <p>"Max Vandenburg left many things in that basement. His fear. His sweat. His nightmares pressed into the floor. But most importantly, he left a story. The greatest story he ever wrote."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Notebook</h2>
            <p>After Max leaves, Liesel opens his notebook. Inside are pages of painted images and handwritten words. A story within a story. A fable about words, power, and resistance.</p>
            <p>It is called The Word Shaker.</p>
        </div>

            <h4>The Word Shaker: A Fable</h4>
            <p>In Max's story, a young Adolf Hitler discovers the power of words. He realizes that words are seeds—plant them in people's minds, and they grow into forests of belief.</p>
            <p>Hitler cultivates his words carefully. He plants them in German soil. They grow into a forest so thick and dark that people become lost in it, unable to see the sun.</p>
            <p>But there is a girl. A word shaker. She plants different seeds—seeds of kindness, of truth, of hope. Her tree grows taller than Hitler's forest. And when she climbs to the top, she can see above the darkness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="book-quote">
            <p>"The best word shakers were the ones who understood the true power of words. They were the ones who could climb the highest. And they were the ones who knew that some words could never be planted; they could only be given."</p>
            <cite>— From The Word Shaker, by Max Vandenburg</cite>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Story's Meaning</h2>
            <p>Max's fable is about Liesel. She is the word shaker. Her stolen books, her readings in the bomb shelter, her weather reports to a hidden Jew—these are the seeds she plants.</p>
            <p>Hitler tried to burn books because he understood their power. Words can enslave or liberate. The same language that built concentration camps can build communities of resistance.</p>
            <p>Liesel chose to shake words that heal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Illustrated Pages</h2>
            <p>Max painted The Word Shaker on the pages of Mein Kampf, just like The Standover Man before it. Hitler's printed words are covered by Max's painted ones.</p>
            <p>There is a profound statement in this: hate can be written over. The same medium used for destruction can be transformed into art. The Word Shaker literally buries Hitler's words beneath a story of hope.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Reflects</h4>
            <p>"I have seen many weapons in my time. Guns and bombs and gases that burn the lungs. But the most powerful weapon I ever saw was a story written on the back of hatred."</p>
            <p>"Max Vandenburg painted forests on fascism. He gave a girl a tree to climb above the darkness. This is what humans can do, if they choose."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Liesel Reads and Writes</h2>
            <p>After absorbing The Word Shaker, Liesel is changed. She understands now what she has been doing instinctively: using words as weapons against despair.</p>
            <p>She continues writing her own book. In the basement where Max once hid, she sits with paper and pencil. She writes about her brother's death, about Hans teaching her to read, about Rudy and his Jesse Owens obsession, about the mayor's library and the books she stole.</p>
            <p>She writes about Max. She will not let him disappear.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hope-box">
            <h4>Words Against Forgetting</h4>
            <p>Liesel realizes that stories are how we fight death. Not physical death—Death always wins that battle. But the death of memory. The death of meaning.</p>
            <p>By writing her story, by recording Max's story, by keeping the words alive, she is planting seeds that will outlast the war, outlast Hitler, outlast even Death himself.</p>
            <p>The word shaker shakes words into the future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Looking for Max</h2>
            <p>Another parade of Jews comes through Molching. Liesel searches every face. Is Max among them? Has he been captured?</p>
            <p>She does not find him. She does not know if this is good or bad.</p>
            <p>Every parade, she looks. Every parade, she fears and hopes in equal measure.</p>
