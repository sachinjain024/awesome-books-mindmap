        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Speaks</h4>
            <p>"I am often there when the bombs come. Collecting souls in the rubble. But in the shelters of Molching, I found something different: a girl's voice holding back fear with nothing but words."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Air Raid Nights</h2>
            <p>The sirens come more frequently now. The people of Himmel Street file into the basement shelter—the Steiners with their six children, Frau Holtzapfel who still spits on the Hubermanns' door, Frau Diller the Nazi shopkeeper.</p>
            <p>In the darkness, surrounded by bodies and fear, people wait for bombs to fall. Some pray. Some cry. Children wail. The air is thick with terror.</p>
            <p>And then Liesel begins to read.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hope-box">
            <h4>Words Against Bombs</h4>
            <p>It starts small. Liesel reads to herself, mouthing the words of The Whistler. A child near her grows quiet, listening. Then another.</p>
            <p>Soon she reads aloud. Her voice fills the shelter. She does not read about the war. She reads about a murderer who whistles—but somehow, this is better than thinking about the real killers flying overhead.</p>
            <p>The bombs fall. But in the shelter, there is only Liesel's voice and the dream she carries in stolen words.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Power of Story</h2>
            <p>The neighbors begin to request readings during air raids. Even Frau Holtzapfel, who has hated the Hubermanns for years, asks Liesel to read to her at home. In exchange, she stops spitting on their door.</p>
            <p>Stories become currency. They are traded for peace, for civility, for moments of escape. Liesel, the girl who couldn't read three years ago, now holds her community together with words.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tragedy-box">
            <h4>Max Falls Ill</h4>
            <p>The cold basement, the lack of sunlight, the constant fear—it was always going to take its toll. Max develops a terrible fever. For weeks, he lies on the edge of death.</p>
            <p>Rosa nurses him. Hans plays the accordion softly. Liesel sits beside him and talks. She brings him presents: a dead leaf, a ribbon from her hair, a feather from a bird outside.</p>
            <p>Most of all, she brings him the weather. She describes every cloud, every color of the sky, every shift of light he cannot see.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Weather Reports</h2>
            <p>Liesel becomes obsessed with the weather. If Max cannot see the sky, she will bring it to him in words.</p>
            <p>"Today there were clouds like lumpy mattresses. The sun came out at three o'clock for exactly nine minutes. A bird—I think it was a sparrow—sat on the fence and looked at me like it knew something."</p>
            <p>She leaves these reports by his bed. She reads them aloud when he stirs. She believes that if she describes the world vividly enough, he will have a reason to stay in it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="book-quote">
            <p>"I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right."</p>
            <cite>— Liesel Meminger</cite>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Between Life and Death</h2>
            <p>Max hovers for weeks. The family prepares for the worst. Rosa even begins to research how they might hide a body if he dies—they cannot take a Jewish corpse to the cemetery.</p>
            <p>But Liesel will not let him go. She sits with him through the nights. She finishes The Whistler and starts The Dream Carrier. She reads the same passages over and over until they become prayers.</p>
            <p>And slowly, impossibly, Max begins to recover.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Reflects</h4>
            <p>"I came for Max Vandenburg several times during those weeks. Each time, something turned me away. A girl's voice. A word she had placed in the air. The desperate belief that language could defeat me."</p>
            <p>"It couldn't, of course. I always come eventually. But sometimes, a story buys time."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Recovery</h2>
            <p>Max wakes. He is skeletal, weak, but alive. The first thing he asks for is a piece of paper and a pencil.</p>
            <p>He begins working on a new project. A story for Liesel. One that will explain everything: words, power, Hitler, resistance, the girl who saved him with weather reports.</p>
            <p>It will be called The Word Shaker.</p>
        </div>
