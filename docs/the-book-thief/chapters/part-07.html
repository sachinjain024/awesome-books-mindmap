            <h3>Death Speaks {.death-narration}</h3>
<p>&quot;They came through Molching in a parade of misery. Pale as paper, thin as wire. They were Jews being marched to Dachau, and they passed right through the town's main street.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hans Hubermann's mistake was not kindness. Kindness is never a mistake. His mistake was being kind in public, in Nazi Germany, where kindness to Jews was a crime punishable by death.&quot;</p>
<h2>The March to Dachau</h2>
<p>The concentration camp at Dachau is not far from Molching.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the Jews are marched through town on their way there.</p>
<p>Liesel stands with the crowd. She sees the starving men shuffling past.</p>
<p>She thinks of Max in the basement, hiding, waiting, hoping to never join this parade.</p>
<h3>Hans's Compassion {.tragedy-box}</h3>
<p>An old Jewish man falls in the street. He cannot get up.</p>
<p>The soldiers are screaming. The crowd is watching.</p>
<p>Hans Hubermann steps forward with a piece of bread.</p>
<p>He gives it to the old man. Helps him stand.</p>
<p>A soldier whips Hans across the face. Six times. Blood runs down his silver eyes.</p>
<h2>The Consequences</h2>
<p>Hans knows immediately what he has done.</p>
<p>By showing compassion to a Jew, he has invited investigation.</p>
<p>If they search his house, they will find Max.</p>
<p>That night, Max must leave. There is no choice.</p>
<h2>The Goodbye</h2>
<p>Max leaves in darkness. He and Liesel have only moments together.</p>
<p>Max gives Liesel his notebook—the one where he's been working on The Word Shaker.</p>
<p>It is not finished, but it is everything he has.</p>
<p>Liesel watches him disappear into the night.</p>
<h2>The Wait</h2>
<p>Hans waits for the knock on the door. For the Gestapo to come.</p>
<p>But the knock doesn't come—at least not in the way he expected.</p>
<p>Instead, Hans receives draft papers. He is being sent to serve in a dangerous unit.</p>
<p>It is a punishment, but not the worst punishment.</p>
<p>Rosa does not cry when he leaves. She tells him to come back.</p>
<h3>The Complete Duden Dictionary and Thesaurus {.stolen-book}</h3>
<p>Before the disaster, before the parade, Ilsa Hermann gave Liesel a gift.</p>
<p><strong>The Complete Duden Dictionary and Thesaurus</strong></p>
<p>Not stolen through a window, but given freely.</p>
<p>It is a book containing all words. Every word in the German language.</p>
<p>It is the ultimate gift from a woman who understands Liesel's hunger.</p>
<h2>Alone</h2>
<p>Hans is gone. Max is gone. Liesel and Rosa are alone on Himmel Street.</p>
<p>Liesel throws herself into books and words, trying to fill the empty spaces.</p>
<p>She begins to write her own book. She calls it The Book Thief.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The March:</strong> Jews parade through Molching on their way to Dachau</li>
<li><strong>Hans's Act:</strong> He gives bread to a fallen Jew and is whipped for his compassion</li>
<li><strong>Max Must Leave:</strong> The danger forces him back into hiding, alone</li>
<li><strong>Hans Is Drafted:</strong> Punishment comes as military service in a dangerous unit</li>
<li><strong>The Dictionary:</strong> Ilsa gives Liesel all the words in the German language</li>
<li><strong>Liesel Begins Writing:</strong> She starts her own book in Max's notebook</li>
</ul>
