            <h3>Death Speaks {.death-narration}</h3>
<p>&quot;The second time I saw the book thief, the sky was the color of Jews—red, the color of flames.&quot; It is the Fuhrer's birthday, April 20, 1940. Molching celebrates with a bonfire of books.</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen a great many things... But I have also seen a girl steal a book from a fire... The question is: what kind of power does a book hold? The answer: all kinds.&quot;</p>
<h2>Rudy Steiner</h2>
<p>Liesel's neighbor and soon her best friend is a skinny boy with bony legs and hair the color of lemons.</p>
<p>At age seven, Rudy painted himself black with charcoal and ran the hundred meters at the local track, pretending to be Jesse Owens.</p>
<p>His father had to explain why a German boy cannot want to be a Black man, no matter how fast that man can run.</p>
<h3>Rudy Steiner {.character-box}</h3>
<p><strong>Best Friend</strong></p>
<p>A boy made of lemon hair and blue eyes, of stolen apples and desperate courage.</p>
<p>He will follow Liesel anywhere.</p>
<p>He asks Liesel for a kiss approximately fourteen thousand times. She always says no. She will regret this forever.</p>
<h2>School and Shame</h2>
<p>Liesel attends school but is placed with the younger children because she cannot read.</p>
<p>The other students mock her. She beats up one boy, Ludwig Schmeikl.</p>
<p>At home, Hans continues the basement lessons. Letter by letter, Liesel catches up.</p>
<h3>The Fuhrer's Birthday {.historical-context}</h3>
<p>April 20, 1940. The town gathers to celebrate Hitler's birthday.</p>
<p>Books deemed &quot;un-German&quot; are piled high and set ablaze. Jewish authors. Communist authors.</p>
<h2>The Book Burning</h2>
<p>Liesel stands with Rosa and Hans, watching the flames consume towers of books.</p>
<p>In the smoldering remains, she spots a book that has survived.</p>
<h3>The Second Stolen Book {.stolen-book}</h3>
<p><strong>The Shoulder Shrug</strong>—a novel that should have burned.</p>
<p>Liesel pulls it from the embers, burning her hands, and hides it beneath her clothes.</p>
<p>She does not notice the mayor's wife watching from across the square. Ilsa Hermann sees everything.</p>
<h2>The Injury</h2>
<p>Liesel's hands are badly burned. Hans notices immediately.</p>
<p>Instead of anger, he treats her wounds and asks to see the book.</p>
<p>They read The Shoulder Shrug together in the basement.</p>
<h2>Words as Rebellion</h2>
<p>By stealing a book from a Nazi fire, Liesel commits her first conscious act of resistance.</p>
<p>In the ashes of the Fuhrer's birthday celebration, a girl becomes a book thief in earnest.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meeting Rudy:</strong> Liesel finds a friend who will follow her anywhere, who loves Jesse Owens, who wants a kiss</li>
<li><strong>School Shame:</strong> Placed with younger children, Liesel fights back with her fists while learning to fight with words</li>
<li><strong>The Burning:</strong> The Fuhrer's birthday bonfire destroys books, but Liesel rescues one from the flames</li>
<li><strong>Ilsa Hermann Watches:</strong> The mayor's wife witnesses the theft, setting up a future connection</li>
<li><strong>Words as Power:</strong> Liesel begins to understand that words can build or destroy worlds</li>
</ul>
