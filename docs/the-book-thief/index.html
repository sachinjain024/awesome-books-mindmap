            <h3>The Books Liesel Steals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Grave Digger's Handbook:</strong> Stolen from the snow beside her brother's grave. Her first book, connecting death and words.</li>
                <li><strong>The Shoulder Shrug:</strong> Rescued from a Nazi book burning. An act of defiance witnessed by the mayor's wife.</li>
                <li><strong>The Whistler:</strong> Taken from Ilsa Hermann's library. The first of many borrowed from the mayor's house.</li>
                <li><strong>The Dream Carrier:</strong> Another library theft, read aloud to calm neighbors during air raids.</li>
                <li><strong>A Song in the Dark:</strong> Left for her by Ilsa after Liesel's angry outburst about Rosa's firing.</li>
                <li><strong>The Complete Duden Dictionary:</strong> Given by the mayor's wife, not stolen. A gift of all words.</li>

            <h3>Major Themes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Power of Words:</strong> Words can destroy (Hitler's propaganda) or save (Liesel's stories in the bomb shelter). Language shapes reality and gives meaning to suffering.</li>
                <li><strong>Death as Narrator:</strong> By having Death tell the story, Zusak shows even mortality is moved by human courage and cruelty. Death is tired, curious, and surprisingly compassionate.</li>
                <li><strong>Ordinary Heroism:</strong> Hans Hubermann, an accordion-playing painter, risks everything to honor a promise. Heroism lives in small acts of defiance and kindness.</li>
                <li><strong>The Color of Memory:</strong> Death sees the world in colors that mark moments of collection. The sky's color becomes a meditation on mortality and meaning.</li>
                <li><strong>Survival Through Story:</strong> Liesel survives by writing her own book. Stories give shape to grief and transform trauma into testimony.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
