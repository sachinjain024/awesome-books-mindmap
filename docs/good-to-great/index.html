            <h2>About This Mind Map</h2>
<p>This mind map presents Jim Collins’ groundbreaking research into what separates great companies from merely good ones. Based on a five-year study of 1,435 companies, Collins and his team identified 11 companies that made the leap from good to great and sustained that greatness for at least 15 years. This mind map distills the key findings, frameworks, and principles that enabled these transformations.</p>

            <h3>Core Stoic Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Level 5 Leadership:</strong> The best leaders combine extreme personal humility with intense professional will. They&#39;re ambitious for the company, not themselves.</li>
                
                <li><strong>First Who, Then What:</strong> Get the right people on the bus first. Strategy comes second to having the right team.</li>
                
                <li><strong>The Stockdale Paradox:</strong> Maintain unwavering faith you will prevail while confronting the brutal facts of your current reality.</li>
                
                <li><strong>The Hedgehog Concept:</strong> Understand the intersection of passion, capability, and economic engine. Stick to what you can be best at.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Culture of Discipline:</strong> Build a culture where disciplined people engage in disciplined thought and take disciplined action.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Technology Accelerators:</strong> Use technology to accelerate momentum, not create it. Avoid technology fads.</li>
                
                <li><strong>The Flywheel Effect:</strong> Greatness is a cumulative process. Consistent effort in one direction builds unstoppable momentum.</li>
                
                <li><strong>The Doom Loop:</strong> Comparison companies lurched between initiatives, never building momentum, reacting rather than driving change.</li>
