            <p>The ancient Greek parable states: “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” While foxes pursue many strategies simultaneously, hedgehogs simplify the world into a single organizing idea. Good-to-great companies think like hedgehogs—they develop a simple but deeply insightful concept that guides all their decisions.</p>
<h2>Foxes vs. Hedgehogs</h2>
<p>Isaiah Berlin’s famous essay divided people into two categories: foxes and hedgehogs. The research found that comparison companies often acted like foxes—pursuing many goals, reacting to opportunities, never achieving crystalline clarity. Good-to-great companies, by contrast, were hedgehogs.</p>
<h3 class="comparison-box">Two Ways of Thinking</h3>
<p><strong>Foxes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pursue many ends simultaneously</li>
<li>See complexity as inherent</li>
<li>Scattered, diffused, inconsistent</li>
<li>Move on many levels</li>
<li>Never integrate into one vision</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hedgehogs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify complexity into one idea</li>
<li>See through complexity to essentials</li>
<li>Focused, unified, consistent</li>
<li>Organize everything by a single principle</li>
<li>Every decision flows from core concept</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Three Circles</h2>
<p>The Hedgehog Concept emerges from the intersection of three fundamental questions. Good-to-great companies discovered what they could be the best at, what drove their economic engine, and what they were deeply passionate about.</p>
<h3 class="concept-box">The Three Circles of the Hedgehog Concept</h3>
<p><strong>1. What can you be the best in the world at?</strong>
(And equally important: what can you NOT be the best at?)</p>
<p><strong>2. What drives your economic engine?</strong>
(The single denominator that has the greatest impact on economics)</p>
<p><strong>3. What are you deeply passionate about?</strong>
(What ignites your passion and the passion of your people)</p>
<p>A true Hedgehog Concept is not a goal, strategy, or intention. It’s an understanding—a deep understanding of what you can and cannot be the best at, combined with passion and economic insight.</p>
<h2>Circle One: What Can You Be Best At?</h2>
<p>This is not about what you want to be best at, or what your core competencies are. It’s about a deep understanding of what you genuinely have the potential to be the best in the world at—and what you cannot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just because something is your core business—just because you’ve been doing it for years or perhaps even decades—does not necessarily mean you can be the best in the world at it.”
— Jim Collins</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="case-study">Abbott Laboratories</h3>
<p>Abbott realized they could never be the best pharmaceutical company—but they could be the best at creating products that contribute to cost-effective health care. This insight led them to focus on diagnostics, nutritionals, and hospital products where they could genuinely be #1.</p>
<h2>Circle Two: Your Economic Engine</h2>
<p>Each good-to-great company attained profound insight into how to most effectively generate sustained and robust cash flow and profitability. They discovered the single denominator—profit per X—that had the greatest impact on their economics.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">Finding Your Economic Denominator</h3>
<p>The key is to identify one ratio—profit per X—that best captures the essence of your economic engine. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Walgreens:</strong> Profit per customer visit (led to convenient locations)</li>
<li><strong>Wells Fargo:</strong> Profit per employee (led to branch productivity focus)</li>
<li><strong>Nucor:</strong> Profit per ton of steel (led to efficient mini-mills)</li>
<li><strong>Fannie Mae:</strong> Profit per mortgage risk level (led to risk assessment mastery)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Circle Three: Your Passion</h2>
<p>Good-to-great companies focused on activities that ignited their passion. This is not about stimulating passion—you can’t manufacture passion. It’s about discovering what you are genuinely passionate about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You can’t manufacture passion or ‘motivate’ people to feel passionate. You can only discover what ignites your passion and the passions of those around you.”
— Jim Collins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The passion circle doesn’t mean cheerleading. Passion is not pumped up from the outside. Gillette wasn’t passionate about blades per se—they were passionate about building sophisticated great brands that make a difference. Philip Morris people were passionate about excellence and being the best.</p>
<h2>The Council</h2>
<p>Good-to-great companies often used an informal “council” to develop and refine their Hedgehog Concept. This wasn’t a committee or task force, but a group of right people who engaged in dialogue and debate to gain understanding.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">Characteristics of the Council</h3>
<ul>
<li>Members have the capability to argue and debate in search of understanding</li>
<li>The council exists as a mechanism for understanding, not decisions</li>
<li>It consists of the right people, not just senior executives</li>
<li>The council is a device for iterating toward insight</li>
</ul>
<h2>Walgreens: A Perfect Example</h2>
<p>Walgreens exemplifies the Hedgehog Concept. Cork Walgreen crystallized a simple concept: be the best, most convenient drugstore, with high profit per customer visit.</p>
<h3 class="case-study">Walgreens’ Hedgehog Concept</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best at:</strong> Being the most convenient drugstore</li>
<li><strong>Economic engine:</strong> Profit per customer visit</li>
<li><strong>Passion:</strong> Excellence in drugstore retailing</li>
</ul>
<p>This concept drove everything: corner locations (even at higher rent), clustering stores, drive-through pharmacies, and satellite technology linking stores. While Eckerd scattered into food service and other areas, Walgreens relentlessly executed their hedgehog concept—and beat the market 15x over.</p>
<h3 class="warning-box">It Takes Time</h3>
<p>Developing a Hedgehog Concept is an iterative process. On average, it took four years for good-to-great companies to clarify their concept. It’s not a brainstorming exercise or strategic planning session—it’s a deep, penetrating understanding that emerges over time.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Hedgehog Concept sits at the intersection of three circles: best at, economic engine, and passion</li>
<li>“Best in the world at” means what you CAN be best at—not what you want to be or currently are</li>
<li>Find your economic denominator: the single ratio (profit per X) that drives your economics</li>
<li>Passion cannot be manufactured—discover what genuinely ignites you</li>
<li>Developing a Hedgehog Concept is an iterative process that takes years, not days</li>
<li>Use a “council” approach—the right people in dialogue—to develop understanding</li>
</ul>
