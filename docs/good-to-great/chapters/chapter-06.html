        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 6: A Culture of Discipline</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Disciplined Action</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Most companies build bureaucratic rules to manage the small percentage of wrong people, which in turn drives away the right people. Good-to-great companies built a culture of discipline—disciplined people who engage in disciplined thought and take disciplined action. When you have disciplined people, you don't need hierarchy. When you have disciplined thought, you don't need bureaucracy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Framework for Greatness</h2>
            <p>Collins synthesizes the good-to-great findings into an integrated framework. Each element of the framework reinforces the others, creating a coherent system.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>The Three Pillars of Discipline</h4>
                <p style="text-align: center; margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <strong>Disciplined People</strong><br>
                    (Level 5 Leadership + First Who... Then What)<br><br>
                    + <strong>Disciplined Thought</strong><br>
                    (Confront the Brutal Facts + Hedgehog Concept)<br><br>
                    + <strong>Disciplined Action</strong><br>
                    (Culture of Discipline + Technology Accelerators)
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Freedom and Responsibility Within a Framework</h2>
            <p>A culture of discipline is not about tyranny or rigid controls. It's about building a framework of freedom and responsibility. People have tremendous freedom within the boundaries of the Hedgehog Concept.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "A culture of discipline is not just about action. It is about getting disciplined people who engage in disciplined thought and who then take disciplined action."
                <div class="attribution">— Jim Collins</div>
            </div>

            <p>This is the genius of the AND: discipline AND entrepreneurship, consistency AND creativity, freedom AND responsibility. It's not either/or—it's both.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Rinsing of Cottage Cheese</h2>
            <p>Collins tells the story of a world-class athlete who, when asked about his extreme discipline (rinsing cottage cheese to reduce fat), replied that it wasn't about cottage cheese—it was about whether he had the discipline to be a champion.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>The Cottage Cheese Principle</h4>
                <p>Good-to-great companies have the discipline to do whatever it takes to become the best within their carefully selected arenas, and then to seek continual improvement from there. This might mean:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saying no to opportunities that don't fit the Hedgehog Concept</li>
                    <li>Refusing to diversify into areas where they can't be the best</li>
                    <li>Eliminating waste and inefficiency relentlessly</li>
                    <li>Maintaining standards even when it's difficult</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>A "Stop Doing" List</h2>
            <p>Most companies have a "to do" list. Good-to-great companies also have a "stop doing" list. This is perhaps even more important—the discipline to stop doing things that don't fit the Hedgehog Concept or that waste resources.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>The Stop Doing List</h4>
                <p>If you have a "to do" list, you need a "stop doing" list. This requires the discipline to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stop pursuing opportunities outside the three circles</li>
                    <li>Stop funding initiatives that aren't working</li>
                    <li>Stop tolerating people who don't fit</li>
                    <li>Stop engaging in activities that dilute focus</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Nucor: Discipline in Action</h2>
            <p>Nucor Steel exemplifies a culture of discipline. Ken Iverson built a company with radically decentralized operations, minimal hierarchy, and tremendous productivity—all held together by a fanatical commitment to their Hedgehog Concept.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Nucor's Culture of Discipline</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only 4 layers of management between CEO and front-line workers</li>
                    <li>Headquarters staff of fewer than 25 people for a Fortune 500 company</li>
                    <li>Workers paid based on productivity—with no guaranteed salary above base</li>
                    <li>Everyone accountable; no hiding in hierarchy</li>
                    <li>Fanatical about their mini-mill, low-cost steel Hedgehog Concept</li>
                    <li>Outperformed Bethlehem Steel by 200x in stock returns</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Bureaucracy vs. Discipline</h2>
            <p>Most companies create bureaucratic rules to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline. But bureaucracy drives away the best people, creating a doom loop of mediocrity.</p>

            <div class="comparison-box">

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Discipline to Stay Focused</h2>
            <p>One of the most important forms of discipline is the discipline to stay within the three circles and resist tempting opportunities that fall outside your Hedgehog Concept.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The good-to-great companies at their best followed a simple mantra: 'Anything that does not fit with our Hedgehog Concept, we will not do. We will not launch unrelated businesses. We will not make unrelated acquisitions. We will not do unrelated joint ventures. If it doesn't fit, we don't do it. Period.'"

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Discipline Without Thinking</h4>
            <p>Discipline without a Hedgehog Concept leads to what Collins calls "the doom loop"—disciplined execution of the wrong things. You can march with great discipline directly into a brick wall. That's why disciplined thought must come before disciplined action. The order matters.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                <li>A culture of discipline combines freedom and responsibility within a framework</li>
                <li>When you have the right people, you don't need much hierarchy or bureaucracy</li>
                <li>Build a "stop doing" list, not just a "to do" list</li>
                <li>Discipline means doing whatever it takes within the Hedgehog Concept—and saying no to everything else</li>
                <li>Bureaucracy compensates for incompetence; discipline makes bureaucracy unnecessary</li>
                <li>Disciplined action must follow disciplined thought—the sequence matters</li>
