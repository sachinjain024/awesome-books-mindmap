            <p>Technology has become a prominent feature of the modern business landscape. Yet the good-to-great research found that technology by itself is never a primary cause of either greatness or decline. Technology is an accelerator—it can accelerate a transformation, but it cannot cause one. Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology.</p>
<h2>The Technology Trap</h2>
<p>During the dot-com bubble, the prevailing belief was that technology was the key to success—that companies that embraced technology would thrive and those that didn't would die. But the research found something different: technology can accelerate a flywheel that's already turning, but it cannot create momentum from nothing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We were surprised to find that fully 80 percent of the good-to-great executives we interviewed didn't even mention technology as one of the top five factors in their transformation.&quot;
— Jim Collins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't mean technology doesn't matter. It means that technology is subordinate to the Hedgehog Concept. Good-to-great companies first figure out what they need to become great, then pioneer the application of carefully selected technologies.</p>
<h2>Technology as Accelerator, Not Creator</h2>
<p>Good-to-great companies approached technology with a critical question: Does this technology fit directly with our Hedgehog Concept? If yes, they became pioneers in applying it. If no, they ignored it or used it in a minimal way.</p>
<h3>The Technology Question {.concept-box}</h3>
<p>Good-to-great companies ask a simple question about any technology:</p>
<p>&quot;Does this technology fit directly with our Hedgehog Concept?&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If yes:</strong> Become a pioneer in its application</li>
<li><strong>If no:</strong> Either ignore it entirely or use it in a limited, basic way</li>
</ul>
<h2>Walgreens: Technology Pioneer</h2>
<p>Walgreens provides a perfect example of technology as accelerator. Their Hedgehog Concept was being the best, most convenient drugstore with high profit per customer visit. Technology that supported this concept was embraced; technology that didn't was ignored.</p>
<h3>Walgreens' Technology Strategy {.case-study}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Built a satellite network connecting all stores—ahead of competitors</li>
<li>Pioneered Intercom Plus, linking customers to any Walgreens pharmacy in America</li>
<li>Created drive-through pharmacies for convenience</li>
<li>Implemented sophisticated inventory systems</li>
<li>Every technology investment linked directly to convenience and profit per visit</li>
</ul>
<p>Eckerd, by comparison, made technology investments that weren't linked to any clear Hedgehog Concept. They invested without the guiding framework, and the investments didn't create sustainable advantage.</p>
<h2>Nucor: Steel Meets Technology</h2>
<p>Nucor became the leading innovator in applying technology to steelmaking—not because they were a technology company, but because specific technologies accelerated their Hedgehog Concept of being the most efficient, low-cost steel producer.</p>
<h3>Nucor's Technology Innovations {.case-study}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pioneered the electric arc furnace mini-mill technology</li>
<li>First to commercially produce thin-slab casting</li>
<li>Invested heavily in technologies that reduced labor costs per ton</li>
<li>All technology investments tied to profit per ton of steel</li>
<li>Bethlehem Steel had access to the same technologies but didn't apply them with the same discipline</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technology and Fear</h2>
<p>Comparison companies often had a reactive relationship with technology—they feared being &quot;left behind&quot; and made investments out of fear rather than strategic clarity. Good-to-great companies were never driven by fear of technology change.</p>
<h3>Two Approaches to Technology {.comparison-box}</h3>
<p><strong>Reactive (Fear-Driven):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;We can't be left behind&quot;</li>
<li>Technology as silver bullet</li>
<li>Invest without clear concept</li>
<li>Follow the hype</li>
<li>Technology creates mediocrity faster</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thoughtful (Hedgehog-Driven):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Does this fit our concept?&quot;</li>
<li>Technology as accelerator</li>
<li>Every investment tied to strategy</li>
<li>Pioneer applications that fit</li>
<li>Technology accelerates momentum</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Those who built the good-to-great companies weren't motivated by fear. They weren't scared of technology or scared of what the world might throw at them. They were motivated by a creative urge and an inner compulsion for sheer unadulterated excellence for its own sake.&quot;
— Jim Collins</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Crawl, Walk, Run Approach</h2>
<p>Good-to-great companies often took a measured approach to technology adoption. They crawled, then walked, then ran—never making huge bets before understanding how technology fit with their concept.</p>
<h3>Crawl, Walk, Run {.principle-box}</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Crawl:</strong> Understand the technology's potential relationship to your Hedgehog Concept</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Walk:</strong> Pilot the technology in limited applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Run:</strong> Become a pioneer in applying it once you understand the fit</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Technology Cannot Fix a Mediocre Strategy {.warning-box}</h3>
<p>When used right, technology can accelerate momentum. But technology alone cannot turn a mediocre company into a great one. If you have the wrong people, the wrong concept, or lack of discipline, no amount of technology will save you. In fact, it will only make you a more expensive failure.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Technology is an accelerator of momentum, not a creator of it</li>
<li>Good-to-great companies pioneer technology that fits their Hedgehog Concept and ignore the rest</li>
<li>Never make technology investments out of fear of being &quot;left behind&quot;</li>
<li>80% of good-to-great executives didn't mention technology as a top-five transformation factor</li>
<li>Take a crawl-walk-run approach: understand fit before making big commitments</li>
<li>Technology cannot fix a broken strategy or compensate for lack of discipline</li>
</ul>
