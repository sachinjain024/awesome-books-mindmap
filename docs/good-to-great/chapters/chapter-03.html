            <p>Conventional wisdom says great companies start by setting a new direction, a new vision and strategy, then getting people committed to that direction. But the good-to-great companies operated differently. They first got the right people on the bus (and the wrong people off the bus), and then figured out where to drive it.</p>
<h2>The Bus Analogy</h2>
<p>Collins introduces the powerful metaphor of a bus to explain this concept. The good-to-great leaders began their transformations by first getting the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats—and then they figured out where to drive it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Look, I don't really know where we should take this bus. But I know this much: If we get the right people on the bus, the right people in the right seats, and the wrong people off the bus, then we'll figure out how to take it someplace great.&quot;
— Jim Collins</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why &quot;Who&quot; Before &quot;What&quot;</h2>
<p>Three practical reasons emerged for why good-to-great companies put &quot;who&quot; before &quot;what&quot;:</p>
<h3>Three Reasons for &quot;First Who&quot; {.principle-box}</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptability:</strong> If you begin with &quot;who,&quot; you can more easily adapt to a changing world. The right people will figure out how to succeed regardless of circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The right people don't need to be tightly managed or fired up. They're self-motivated by the inner drive to produce the best results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direction clarity:</strong> If you have the wrong people, it doesn't matter whether you discover the right direction—you still won't have a great company.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Not a &quot;Genius with 1000 Helpers&quot;</h2>
<p>The comparison companies often followed a &quot;genius with a thousand helpers&quot; model—a brilliant leader who sets the vision and recruits people to help execute it. The problem: when the genius leaves, the helpers are lost.</p>
<h3>Leadership Models Compared {.comparison-box}</h3>
<p><strong>Genius with Helpers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leader is the genius</li>
<li>Others execute the vision</li>
<li>System depends on the genius</li>
<li>Collapse when leader leaves</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right People on Bus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collective intelligence</li>
<li>Debate and dialogue to find best answers</li>
<li>System is self-sustaining</li>
<li>Continues after leader transition</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rigorous, Not Ruthless</h2>
<p>Getting the right people on the bus requires rigorous standards—but good-to-great companies were not ruthless cultures. There's a crucial distinction:</p>
<h3>Rigorous vs. Ruthless {.concept-box}</h3>
<p><strong>Ruthless</strong> means hacking and cutting, especially in difficult times, or firing people without thoughtful consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Rigorous</strong> means consistently applying exacting standards at all times and at all levels, especially in upper management. It means making tough decisions about people while treating everyone with dignity.</p>
<p>The good-to-great companies had cultures where people either thrived or quickly self-selected out. There was no ambiguity about what was expected.</p>
<h2>Three Practical Disciplines</h2>
<p>The research revealed three practical disciplines for being rigorous about people:</p>
<h3>Discipline #1: When in Doubt, Don't Hire {.principle-box}</h3>
<p>Good-to-great companies limited their growth by their ability to attract enough of the right people. They'd rather delay growth than hire the wrong people. A company should keep looking until it finds the right person.</p>
<h3>Discipline #2: Act When You Know You Need to Make a Change {.principle-box}</h3>
<p>The moment you feel the need to tightly manage someone, you've made a hiring mistake. The best people don't need to be managed. When you know you need to make a people change, act. Waiting too long is unfair to the people who are performing.</p>
<h3>Discipline #3: Put Your Best People on Your Biggest Opportunities {.principle-box}</h3>
<p>If you want to get rid of problems, don't sell off your problems with your best people. Let your best people work on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems. Managing problems makes you good; exploiting opportunities makes you great.</p>
<h2>Wells Fargo: A Case Study</h2>
<p>Dick Cooley at Wells Fargo exemplified the &quot;First Who&quot; principle. In the 1970s, he began building one of the most talented management teams in banking—long before he knew what changes banking deregulation would bring.</p>
<h3>Wells Fargo's Approach {.case-study}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cooley focused on injecting a stream of talented people into the veins of the organization</li>
<li>He hired outstanding people regardless of whether he had a specific job for them</li>
<li>When deregulation hit, Wells Fargo was ready—they had the right people to figure it out</li>
<li>Bank of America, their comparison, had to scramble to bring in outsiders</li>
<li>Wells Fargo beat the market by 3x; Bank of America fell 59% behind</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compensation: Not the Driver</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, the research found no systematic pattern linking executive compensation to the shift from good to great. How you pay people matters less than who you pay and whether they are the right people in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The purpose of compensation is not to 'motivate' the right behaviors from the wrong people, but to get and keep the right people in the first place.&quot;
— Jim Collins</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Danger of &quot;What&quot; Before &quot;Who&quot; {.warning-box}</h3>
<p>Comparison companies often focused on &quot;what&quot; first—pursuing hot markets, new strategies, or turnaround programs. But without the right people, even the best strategies fail. And when the market shifts, there's no one capable of adapting.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Get the right people on the bus first, then figure out where to drive it</li>
<li>The right people are self-motivated and don't need to be tightly managed</li>
<li>Be rigorous (not ruthless) about people decisions</li>
<li>When in doubt, don't hire—keep looking for the right person</li>
<li>When you know you need to make a people change, act promptly</li>
<li>Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems</li>
</ul>
