<p>“We’re paralyzed by the fantasy that if we could just keep our options open for a little longer, we’ll be able to make the perfect choice. But meaningful achievement requires burning bridges—committing to one path and giving up all the others.”
— Oliver Burkeman</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Paradox of Choice</h2>
<p>Modern life presents us with unprecedented choice. You can pursue any career, live in any city, date anyone in the world (via apps), learn any skill (via YouTube), consume any media (via streaming), become any version of yourself you imagine.</p>
<p>This abundance sounds liberating. And in some ways it is—far better than rigid traditional societies where your path was determined by birth. But Burkeman identifies a dark side to infinite options: they make genuine commitment nearly impossible.</p>
<p>When you could theoretically do anything, choosing one thing means closing off countless others. Every commitment is simultaneously a renunciation. Every path chosen is hundreds of paths not taken. And our psychology struggles mightily with this.</p>
<h3 class="trap-box">The Cost of Keeping Options Open</h3>
<p>Modern culture celebrates “keeping your options open” as sophisticated and intelligent. Don’t commit too early. Don’t close doors. Stay flexible. Keep pivoting. Maintain multiple possibilities.</p>
<p>But here’s what we don’t acknowledge: keeping options open has profound costs. Every option you keep alive requires some of your finite attention and energy. The person trying to simultaneously advance in three different careers makes less progress in all of them than someone committed to one. The person keeping multiple romantic possibilities open never develops deep intimacy with any of them.</p>
<p>More subtly, keeping options open prevents the deep satisfaction that comes only through commitment. You can’t know what a commitment is truly like—what depth it offers, what rewards it brings—until you’ve burned the bridges and fully given yourself to it.</p>
<h2>The Bus Metaphor</h2>
<p>Burkeman uses a powerful metaphor: life is like being on a bus. At every stop, you could get off and catch a different bus going somewhere else. There are always other buses, other destinations, other possibilities.</p>
<p>The fantasy of infinite choice says you should keep evaluating whether you’re on the right bus. Maybe the next bus would be better? Maybe that other destination is more interesting? Maybe you should get off and reassess?</p>
<p>But here’s the truth: you only get to see what a particular bus journey offers if you stay on it long enough. If you’re constantly getting off to check whether there’s a better bus, you never actually go anywhere. You spend your life at the bus station, comparing options, never committing long enough to discover what any particular path might offer.</p>
<h3 class="insight-box">The Commitment Paradox</h3>
<p>This creates what we might call the commitment paradox: the very abundance that gives us so many options makes it psychologically harder to commit to any of them, which means we never fully experience what any option might offer.</p>
<p>You can’t discover what marriage to this particular person offers if you’re always mentally comparing them to other possibilities. You can’t discover what mastery of this craft offers if you’re constantly considering switching to something else. You can’t discover what this city offers if you’re perpetually thinking about moving.</p>
<p>The only way to truly experience what a choice offers is to choose it fully, to burn the bridges, to commit despite uncertainty. But our option-obsessed culture makes this feel reckless rather than necessary.</p>
<h2>The Terror of Finitude</h2>
<p>Why is commitment so difficult? Because every genuine commitment forces you to confront your finitude directly.</p>
<p>When you commit to one career, you’re acknowledging you won’t pursue countless others. When you commit to one person, you’re accepting you won’t experience relationships with millions of others. When you commit to living in one place, you’re recognizing you won’t live everywhere.</p>
<p>Each commitment is a small death—the death of the possibility of being something else, experiencing something else, becoming someone else. And in our death-denying culture, we avoid these small deaths by avoiding commitment.</p>
<p>But avoiding commitment doesn’t avoid finitude—it just ensures you experience nothing deeply. You remain in the shallow water of kept-open options, never diving deep enough to discover what commitment might offer.</p>
<h3 class="philosophy-box">The Fantasy of Perfect Information</h3>
<p>Often, we tell ourselves we’re keeping options open until we have enough information to make the “right” choice. If we just research more, experience more, keep options alive longer, eventually we’ll know which path is optimal.</p>
<p>But this is a fantasy. For most important life choices, you can never have perfect information. You can’t know what marriage to this person will be like until you’re married. You can’t know what this career will be like until you’ve committed to it. You can’t know what living in this city will offer until you’ve lived there.</p>
<p>The information you need to make a perfect choice is only available after you’ve made the choice and lived with it. Trying to keep options open until you have perfect information means never committing to anything.</p>
<h2>The Case for Burning Bridges</h2>
<p>Burkeman makes a radical argument: sometimes, burning bridges—deliberately closing off options—is exactly what you need.</p>
<p>When you burn bridges, you remove the possibility of escape. You can no longer flee when things get difficult. You’re committed. And paradoxically, this constraint is liberating.</p>
<p>When you can’t keep reassessing whether you made the right choice, you can finally engage fully with the choice you made. When you can’t constantly compare your actual life to hypothetical alternatives, you can be present with your actual life. When the escape routes are closed, you can go deep.</p>
<h3 class="practice-exercise">Examples of Bridge-Burning</h3>
<p><strong>Career:</strong> Turning down opportunities in other fields so you can go deep in one. Saying “I’m a writer,” not “I’m keeping my options open.”</p>
<p><strong>Relationships:</strong> Committing to one person, closing off the fantasy of someone better out there. Choosing this relationship over hypothetical others.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Actually moving somewhere, selling the other house, ending the “maybe I’ll move” speculation.</p>
<p><strong>Creative work:</strong> Committing to this project, even though you could work on that other one. Choosing depth over breadth.</p>
<p><strong>Learning:</strong> Going deep in one skill rather than staying shallow across many. Accepting you won’t become an expert in everything.</p>
<p>The common thread: accepting limitation, choosing depth over breadth, committing despite uncertainty.</p>
<h2>The Rewards of Commitment</h2>
<p>What do you get for burning bridges and committing? Several things that aren’t available any other way:</p>
<p><strong>Depth:</strong> You only discover what something truly offers when you go deep enough to pass the initial difficulties and discover what lies beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Mastery:</strong> Real skill only emerges through sustained commitment over time. You can’t become excellent at something you keep one foot out of.</p>
<p><strong>Intimacy:</strong> Deep connection—with people, places, or crafts—requires the vulnerability of full commitment. Holding back prevents intimacy.</p>
<p><strong>Peace:</strong> The constant reassessment of whether you’ve made the right choice is exhausting. Commitment brings relief from that particular form of anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Research suggests meaning comes more from depth than breadth. Deep engagement with few things beats shallow engagement with many.</p>
<h3 class="solution-box">Staying on Your Bus</h3>
<p>How do you practice “staying on the bus”?</p>
<p><strong>Notice when you’re reassessing:</strong> Throughout the day, notice when you’re mentally getting off your bus. “Should I be doing this career?” “Is this the right relationship?” “Should I live somewhere else?” Just notice the reassessment habit.</p>
<p><strong>Choose committed attention:</strong> When you notice your mind wandering to other options, bring your full attention back to what you’ve chosen. This project, this person, this place, this path.</p>
<p><strong>Accept buyer’s remorse:</strong> After any significant choice, you’ll feel some regret for paths not taken. This is normal. Acknowledge it and stay committed anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Practice small commitments:</strong> Build your commitment muscle with small decisions. Finish the book you started. Complete the project. See the conversation through. Practice not abandoning things.</p>
<p><strong>Burn a bridge:</strong> Identify one place where you’re hedging, keeping options open unnecessarily. Close that option. Feel the liberation of commitment.</p>
<h2>The Freedom of Constraint</h2>
<p>The final paradox: constraint is freedom. When you close off infinite possibilities and commit to one path, you’re finally free to explore that path fully. When you burn bridges, you’re free from the constant burden of reassessing whether you made the right choice.</p>
<p>Infinite options create paralysis. Commitment creates possibility. The person who could do anything often does nothing deeply. The person who commits to one thing can discover what that thing truly offers.</p>
<h3 class="reflection">What Bus Are You On?</h3>
<p>You’re on some bus right now—some career path, some relationship, some life situation, some creative project. And there are probably other buses you could catch instead.</p>
<p>But here’s the question: have you fully committed to this bus? Or are you riding it while constantly looking out the window at other possibilities, mentally getting off at every stop to reassess?</p>
<p>What would it feel like to burn the bridges? To commit fully to this path, even with all its uncertainty? What might you discover that’s only available through commitment?</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
