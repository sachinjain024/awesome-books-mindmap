<p>“We speak of ‘having’ time or ‘not having’ time, as if it were a possession. But time isn’t something we have—it’s what we are.”
— Oliver Burkeman</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Language of Time</h2>
<p>Listen to how we talk about time: “I don’t have time for that.” “I need to find more time.” “That project is a waste of time.” “I’m trying to save time.” “I’ll make time for you.”</p>
<p>All these phrases treat time as if it were a possession—something we can have or not have, find or lose, save or waste, make or allocate. This metaphor is so embedded in our language and thinking that we barely notice it. But Burkeman argues that this way of conceptualizing time is fundamentally mistaken—and that this mistake is a root cause of our time-related anxiety.</p>
<h3 class="philosophy-box">Time is Not a Possession</h3>
<p>You don’t “have” time the way you have money in a bank account or tools in a shed. Time isn’t something external to you that you can accumulate, save up, or spend wisely. Rather, time is what you are. You are a temporal being—a process unfolding in time, not an entity that possesses time.</p>
<p>This might sound like philosophical hair-splitting, but it has profound practical implications. When you think you “have” time, you naturally try to manage it—to use it efficiently, to get more out of it, to control how it’s spent. This leads to the efficiency trap, the productivity obsession, the constant feeling that you’re not using your time well enough.</p>
<p>But you can’t manage what you are. You can only live it.</p>
<h2>The Problem of Control</h2>
<p>The “having time” metaphor creates an illusion of control. If time is something you possess, then you should be able to control it—organize it better, use it more efficiently, make better decisions about how to allocate it.</p>
<p>This illusion drives the entire productivity industry: apps and systems and techniques all promising to help you “take control of your time,” to “master your schedule,” to “get more out of every hour.” The implicit promise is that with the right approach, you can finally bend time to your will.</p>
<p>But this is based on a category error. Time isn’t something you control; it’s the medium in which you exist. You can make choices about what you do in time, but you can’t control time itself. It passes at exactly one second per second, regardless of how efficiently you schedule it.</p>
<h3 class="trap-box">The Futility of Time Management</h3>
<p>This reveals the deep futility of conventional time management. You can get better at organizing tasks, at prioritizing, at working efficiently. But none of this gives you more time. The clock keeps ticking at the same pace. The years keep passing. Your four thousand weeks keep counting down.</p>
<p>What conventional time management actually does is help you fit more stuff into your time—which, as we’ve seen in the efficiency trap, usually just makes you feel busier and more overwhelmed. It doesn’t solve the fundamental problem of finitude; it just helps you deny it more effectively for a while.</p>
<p>The real problem isn’t that you’re bad at time management. It’s that you’re treating time as something to be managed in the first place.</p>
<h2>Waiting for Permission to Live</h2>
<p>The “having time” metaphor creates another problem: it encourages us to wait for the right time to do what matters. We tell ourselves we’ll pursue our creative project when we “have more time.” We’ll spend quality time with family when we “find the time.” We’ll start that business, write that book, take that trip when we “make time.”</p>
<p>But notice the logic here: we’re waiting for time we don’t currently “have” to magically appear before we can live the life we want. We’re postponing actual living until we achieve some future state where we’ll finally “have enough time.”</p>
<p>This future state never arrives. There’s no magical point where you suddenly “have time” for everything. Time doesn’t accumulate like money—you never have more than right now, this moment.</p>
<h3 class="insight-box">The Eternal Present</h3>
<p>Here’s a startling truth: you never experience anything except the present moment. The past is memory; the future is imagination. All you ever actually have is now.</p>
<p>Yet we spend most of our mental energy in past or future—ruminating on what happened, planning what’s next, worrying about what might be. We treat the present as a stepping stone to a better future, a path to the time when we’ll finally “have time” for what matters.</p>
<p>But the present is all there is. This moment is your life. Not a preparation for your life, not a stepping stone to your real life—this is it. When you’re waiting for the right time to start living, you’re wasting the only time you actually have.</p>
<h2>The Alternative: Being Time</h2>
<p>So if we don’t “have” time, what’s the alternative? Burkeman suggests shifting from having time to being time—from treating time as a possession to recognizing yourself as a temporal process.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean passively letting life happen to you. It means recognizing that living is something you’re doing right now, in this moment, not something you’re preparing for or planning to do when conditions are right.</p>
<p>It means asking not “How can I manage my time better?” but “What kind of temporal being am I choosing to be right now? What am I doing with the moment I am?”</p>
<h3 class="practice-exercise">Practical Implications</h3>
<p>What does this shift look like in practice?</p>
<p><strong>Stop waiting for the right time:</strong> If something matters to you, the only time you have for it is now. Not “when you have more time,” but in the actual time that constitutes your current life.</p>
<p><strong>Recognize planning as present activity:</strong> Planning for the future isn’t separate from living—it’s something you’re doing now. The question is whether it’s what you want to be doing with this present moment.</p>
<p><strong>Notice when you’re “spending” time:</strong> When you catch yourself thinking about “spending time” on something, notice the possessive metaphor. You’re not spending time; you’re being alive in a particular way. Is this how you want to be alive right now?</p>
<p><strong>Accept that this is it:</strong> This day, this hour, this moment—this is your life happening. Not a rehearsal, not preparation. The real thing.</p>
<h2>The Liberation of Impermanence</h2>
<p>Paradoxically, recognizing that you don’t “have” time can be liberating. When you stop trying to control and manage time, when you accept that you’re a temporal process rather than an entity that possesses time, the pressure eases.</p>
<p>You can stop trying to optimize every moment, because optimization is the wrong category. You’re not trying to extract maximum value from a resource you possess. You’re simply living—being alive in time, moment by moment.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean becoming passive or aimless. It means being more direct, more honest about what you’re actually doing. Not “I’m spending time on social media” (which sounds strategic, like an investment) but “I’m choosing to scroll social media right now” (which is simply true). Not “I don’t have time for that” (which sounds like a resource constraint) but “I’m not choosing to prioritize that” (which is more honest).</p>
<h3 class="reflection">What Are You Being?</h3>
<p>Right now, you are being something. You are being alive in a particular way—reading these words, sitting somewhere, breathing, thinking, existing as a process unfolding in time.</p>
<p>This moment will never come again. You don’t “have” this time in any meaningful sense—you are this time. The question isn’t whether you’re using it wisely, but whether you’re living in a way that feels true and meaningful.</p>
<p>What are you choosing to be?</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“Having time” is a misleading metaphor:</strong> time isn’t a possession we can accumulate, save, or spend—it’s what we are, the medium of our existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The illusion of control drives time anxiety:</strong> thinking we can “manage” time like a resource creates unrealistic expectations and perpetual frustration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conventional time management can’t solve finitude:</strong> organizing tasks more efficiently doesn’t give you more time; it just helps you deny your limits more effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Waiting for the “right time” is waiting to live:</strong> there’s no future moment when you’ll suddenly “have time”—the only time you ever have is this present moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You experience only the present moment:</strong> past is memory, future is imagination—all actual living happens now, yet we spend most mental energy elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shift from having time to being time:</strong> recognize yourself as a temporal process, ask not “how do I manage time?” but “what kind of being am I choosing to be right now?”</p>
</li>
</ul>
