            <blockquote>
<p>&quot;Peace of mind comes from accepting that you're standing right where you're standing—not where you wish you were, or where you plan to be, but where you actually are.&quot;
— Oliver Burkeman</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Tyranny of Elsewhere</h2>
<p>One of the most persistent forms of time-related suffering is what we might call &quot;the tyranny of elsewhere&quot;—the habit of mentally living somewhere other than where you actually are.</p>
<p>You're at work, but your mind is at home worrying about household tasks. You're at home, but your mind is at work fretting about tomorrow's deadline. You're with your family, but your mind is reviewing the past or planning the future. You're in the present moment, but your consciousness is anywhere but here.</p>
<p>This split between where you are and where your mind is creates a constant low-grade anxiety. You're never fully anywhere. You're always mentally leaning into some other time or place, treating where you are as merely a stepping stone to where you're going.</p>
<h3>The &quot;Once I&quot; Trap {.trap-box}</h3>
<p>This split often takes the form of &quot;once I&quot; thinking: &quot;Once I finish this project, I'll relax.&quot; &quot;Once I get that promotion, I'll be happy.&quot; &quot;Once the kids are older, I'll have time for myself.&quot; &quot;Once I retire, I'll finally live.&quot;</p>
<p>The problem is that &quot;once I&quot; never arrives. When you finish the project, there's another one. When you get the promotion, you want the next one. When the kids are older, you have different challenges. When you retire, you realize you've spent your whole life preparing for a future that's always one step ahead.</p>
<p>This isn't to say you shouldn't have goals or plans. It's that when you make your present peace of mind conditional on some future state, you guarantee perpetual dissatisfaction. You're literally refusing to accept where you are, holding out for some other time and place.</p>
<h2>Accepting Your Actual Life</h2>
<p>Burkeman proposes a radical alternative: accepting where you actually are. Not where you wish you were, not where you plan to be, not where you think you should be—but where you are, right now, in reality.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean passive resignation or giving up on change. It means starting from reality rather than fantasy. It means acknowledging your actual circumstances, your actual capacities, your actual life—and working from there rather than from some imagined ideal.</p>
<h3>The Gap Between Should and Is {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>Much of our suffering comes from the gap between how we think our life should be and how it actually is. We compare our actual messy, complicated, imperfect life to some imagined ideal—and find it lacking.</p>
<p>We think we should be further along in our career by now. We think we should be more organized, more disciplined, more productive. We think our relationships should be smoother, our days less chaotic, our lives more under control.</p>
<p>But &quot;should&quot; is a fantasy. &quot;Is&quot; is reality. And the gap between them creates constant dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Accepting where you are means closing this gap—not by magically making your life match the ideal, but by accepting your actual life as your actual life, worthy of full engagement rather than constant judgment.</p>
<h2>The Present Isn't Preparation</h2>
<p>One of the deepest forms of &quot;elsewhere&quot; thinking is treating the present as mere preparation for a future that matters more. We endure our current job to build toward a better career. We sacrifice our current relationships for future success. We defer joy and meaning until someday when conditions will be right.</p>
<p>This is what Burkeman calls treating the present as &quot;a path to a better future&quot; rather than as life itself. It's living as if the real life—the one that counts—is always ahead of you, and this present moment is just the price you pay to get there.</p>
<p>But the present isn't preparation. It's the main event. This moment is your life happening, not a rehearsal for your life. When you treat it as merely a path to somewhere else, you're not actually living—you're deferring living until some mythical future.</p>
<h3>The Infinite Regress {.philosophy-box}</h3>
<p>This future-oriented mindset creates an infinite regress. If this moment is just preparation for a better future, then when that future arrives, won't it also be just preparation for something else?</p>
<p>When you get the promotion you were working toward, you'll start working toward the next promotion. When you reach the retirement you've been sacrificing for, you'll start working on your health for your later years. There's always something further ahead, always another milestone that will supposedly make everything worthwhile.</p>
<p>The only way to escape this infinite regress is to accept that this moment—whatever its circumstances—is not preparation for life. It is life.</p>
<h2>The Practice of Here-ness</h2>
<p>So how do you actually practice being where you are? Burkeman offers several approaches:</p>
<p><strong>Notice when you're elsewhere:</strong> Throughout the day, notice when your mind has wandered away from where you are. Not to judge yourself, but simply to notice. &quot;Ah, I'm sitting with my child, but thinking about work.&quot; &quot;Ah, I'm at work, but worrying about home.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Come back:</strong> When you notice you're elsewhere, gently return your attention to where you actually are. What's happening right here, right now? What's this moment actually like when you're fully in it?</p>
<p><strong>Accept this version:</strong> You might have an ideal version of how this moment should be unfolding. Accept the version that's actually unfolding instead. This conversation might not be going as you hoped—but this is the conversation you're actually having.</p>
<p><strong>Notice the resistance:</strong> Pay attention to your resistance to being here. What are you resisting about this moment? Why do you want to be somewhere else? Often, just noticing the resistance helps it soften.</p>
<h3>Practical Here-ness {.practice-exercise}</h3>
<p><strong>Start your day here:</strong> Instead of immediately planning or worrying about what's ahead, spend a few minutes simply noticing where you are. What room are you in? What sensations do you notice? What's happening right now?</p>
<p><strong>End tasks clearly:</strong> When you finish one activity, pause before rushing to the next. Acknowledge what you just did, where you are now, before moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Notice transitions:</strong> Commutes, waiting rooms, time between meetings—these are often when our minds escape to elsewhere. Practice staying present during transitions.</p>
<p><strong>Accept your actual energy:</strong> You might wish you had more energy, felt more motivated, were in a better mood. Accept the energy level you actually have and work with that.</p>
<p><strong>Practice &quot;just this&quot;:</strong> Whatever you're doing, try bringing all your attention to just this. Not this-plus-planning-the-next-thing, but just this, fully.</p>
<h2>The Paradox of Acceptance</h2>
<p>Here's the paradox: accepting where you are doesn't prevent change—it enables it. When you're constantly rejecting your current reality, comparing it to how things should be, you're too busy fighting what is to actually work with it.</p>
<p>But when you accept where you are—&quot;This is my actual life, these are my actual circumstances, this is where I actually am right now&quot;—you can finally engage with reality as it is. You can make real decisions based on truth rather than fantasy. You can take actual steps from your actual location, rather than imaginary steps from an imaginary ideal position.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, accepting that you are here, now, often makes genuine progress possible—because you're finally starting from reality.</p>
<h3>Where Are You? {.reflection}</h3>
<p>Stop for a moment. Notice where you actually are. Not where you wish you were. Not where you'll be later. Not where you think you should be.</p>
<p>Where are you right now? What's actually happening in this moment? What's this experience actually like when you stop resisting it and lean into it?</p>
<p>You are here. This is your life, happening. What if that was okay?</p>
