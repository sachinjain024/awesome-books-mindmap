<p>“The cowards never started and the weak died along the way. That leaves us, ladies and gentlemen. Us.”
— Phil Knight</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The World Trip and a Hunch</h2>
<p>It is 1962. Phil Knight is 24 years old, fresh from Stanford Business School with an MBA and an idea he can barely articulate — an idea that, when he tries to explain it to people, earns mostly polite skepticism or outright laughter. The idea: import high-quality, affordable running shoes from Japan and sell them to American athletes.</p>
<p>Knight had been a runner at Oregon — good enough, but never great. He understood, from the inside, what it felt like to run in shoes that didn’t fit properly, that fell apart after a hundred miles, or that cost more than a week’s groceries. American running shoes in 1962 were either expensive German imports from Adidas and Puma, or cheap domestic brands that didn’t perform. There had to be a better way.</p>
<p>On a round-the-world trip after graduating, Knight finds himself in Japan. He has no appointment, no connections, and no money. On a whim, he walks into the offices of Onitsuka Tiger — a Japanese athletic shoe company based in Kobe — and introduces himself as a representative of an American company called Blue Ribbon Sports. The company doesn’t exist yet. He makes it up on the spot.</p>
<h3 class="insight-box">The Onitsuka Tiger Meeting</h3>
<p>What follows is one of the great moments of entrepreneurial audacity in business history. The Onitsuka executives — curious, gracious, and intrigued by this earnest young American — show Knight their factory and their shoes. He is astonished by the quality. These shoes are as good as anything Adidas makes, and they cost a fraction of the price. He shakes hands on a deal: he will be their exclusive importer on the West Coast of America.</p>
<p>Knight doesn’t fully understand what he’s agreed to. He doesn’t have the money to pay for any shoes yet. He doesn’t have a warehouse, an office, or even a business entity. But he has a handshake — and a belief so strong it borders on irrational — that this is going to work.</p>
<h2>Back in Oregon: The Crazy Idea Meets Reality</h2>
<p>Knight returns to Oregon and does the sensible thing: he gets a job as an accountant while he waits for the Tiger shoes to arrive. He tells his track coach, Bill Bowerman, about the idea. Bowerman — one of the most respected coaches in American track — is the first person to take Knight seriously. He looks at the Tigers and immediately starts pulling them apart to see how they’re made.</p>
<p>Knight’s father is less enthusiastic. He calls the idea “crazy.” He’s right, in one sense — it is crazy. But as Knight will come to understand, most great ideas seem crazy until they aren’t.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">What Makes an Idea “Crazy”</h3>
<p>Knight reflects throughout the book on the nature of the crazy idea. Most people who have them talk themselves out of acting. The gap between having an idea and actually doing something about it — booking the flight, walking into the office, shaking the hand — is where most entrepreneurial stories end before they begin.</p>
<p>Knight’s lesson is not that everyone should quit their job and follow every whim. It’s that when you have an idea that won’t leave you alone, that keeps interrupting your sleep and your conversations, that feels more like a calling than a plan — you owe it to yourself to at least try.</p>
<h2>The First Order</h2>
<p>The Tiger shoes finally arrive: twelve pairs, ordered as a sample. Knight sends two pairs to his old coach Bowerman, who immediately writes back with design suggestions. He sells the other ten pairs from the trunk of his car at track meets, and sells out in days.</p>
<p>The feedback is immediate and overwhelming: runners love these shoes. They’re light, well-made, and affordable. Knight writes to Onitsuka to order more.</p>
<h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>What is the “crazy idea” you’ve been carrying? What would it take to make one phone call, send one email, or walk into one office — just to see if the idea has legs?</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The most important step is the first one — acting on the idea despite uncertainty and ridicule</li>
<li>Knight had no business, no money, and no connections when he walked into Onitsuka Tiger; he had only conviction</li>
<li>The first market test (12 pairs of shoes, sold from a car trunk) validated the idea instantly</li>
<li>A crazy idea with strong market feedback beats a safe idea with no customers</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship often begins with a handshake on something that doesn’t yet exist</li>
<li>The gap between having an idea and acting on it is where most entrepreneurial stories end before they start</li>
