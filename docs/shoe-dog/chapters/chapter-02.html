<p>“Supply and demand is actually a love affair. You have to court both sides.”
— Phil Knight</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Shoes Arrive</h2>
<p>The year is 1963. Phil Knight is juggling two lives: by day, a CPA at an accounting firm in Portland; by night and weekend, a shoe salesman running a company that consists of himself, a post office box, and a growing stack of letters from Onitsuka Tiger in Kobe.</p>
<p>The next shipment of Tiger shoes arrives — three hundred pairs, a real order. Knight arranges financing through his father and begins selling in earnest. He travels the track meet circuit in the Pacific Northwest, popping the trunk of his car and laying shoes on a blanket. Athletes crowd around. Word spreads. He sells out, orders more, sells out again.</p>
<p>The business is growing. But Knight can’t do it alone while holding down a day job.</p>
<h3 class="insight-box">Recruiting Bill Bowerman</h3>
<p>Bill Bowerman is one of the most important figures in the history of running in America. As head track coach at the University of Oregon, he coached multiple Olympic medalists and pioneered training methods that revolutionized the sport. He also had an obsession that would prove valuable: he believed American running shoes were poorly designed, and he spent his own time re-engineering them.</p>
<p>When Knight approaches Bowerman with a formal offer — a 50-50 partnership in Blue Ribbon Sports — Bowerman accepts immediately. He isn’t interested in the money (he already sends Knight unsolicited design modifications for every pair of Tigers he receives). He is interested in having a direct pipeline to a shoe manufacturer willing to implement his ideas.</p>
<p>It is a perfect partnership: Knight has the business sense and the supplier relationship; Bowerman has the design genius and the credibility in the running world. Together, they are formidable.</p>
<h2>Jeff Johnson: The First Full-Timer</h2>
<p>If Bowerman is the genius, Jeff Johnson is the obsessive. Knight hires Johnson — a former competitive runner who had briefly worked for Adidas — as the company’s first full-time salesperson. Johnson is paid a commission. No salary. No benefits. Just a territory (California) and the deep conviction that these shoes are the best on the market.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">Johnson’s Letters</h3>
<p>What follows is one of the great subplots in <em>Shoe Dog</em>: a years-long torrent of letters from Jeff Johnson to Phil Knight. Johnson writes constantly — about the shoes, about his customers, about their dreams and injuries and race times. He writes about his own life, his obsessions, his loneliness. Knight, who was never naturally warm, barely writes back.</p>
<p>But these letters are a window into something crucial: Jeff Johnson was doing customer development before the term existed. He knew every customer by name, remembered their shoe sizes, mailed them birthday cards and race results. He turned running shoe sales into a deeply personal relationship.</p>
<p>Johnson also came up with the name “Nike” — the Greek goddess of victory — years before it was needed.</p>
<h2>Selling at Track Meets</h2>
<p>Blue Ribbon’s early sales strategy is delightfully unsophisticated: set up at track meets, put the shoes on a blanket, and let athletes try them on. The product sells itself. Runners can immediately feel the difference — the lightness, the quality of the sole, the precise fit of the heel counter.</p>
<p>Knight is a shy man by nature, but he discovers he can talk about running shoes for hours without effort. His passion for the product overcomes his introversion. This is an early lesson he absorbs without fully articulating it yet: when you believe in what you’re selling, selling isn’t selling. It’s sharing.</p>
<h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>What would it mean to sell something you believed in so completely that selling didn’t feel like selling? What does genuine product passion do for a business — and for the person doing the selling?</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The right co-founder brings capabilities you don’t have — Bowerman’s design genius complemented Knight’s business instincts perfectly</li>
<li>Jeff Johnson’s obsessive customer relationships created a loyal base that no competitor could replicate through advertising alone</li>
<li>Passion for the product transforms the sales experience for both seller and buyer</li>
<li>Early validation through direct customer feedback is more valuable than market research</li>
<li>A commission-only salesperson who believes in the product will outperform a salaried one who doesn’t</li>
<li>Even without formal systems, small companies can build intense customer loyalty through personal attention</li>
</ul>
