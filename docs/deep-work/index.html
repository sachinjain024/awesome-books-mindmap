        <h1>Deep Work</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <h2>About This Mind Map</h2>
            <p>Deep Work is Cal Newport's groundbreaking book on the value of focused, distraction-free work in our increasingly scattered digital age. Newport argues that the ability to perform deep work is becoming both rare and valuable—making it a superpower for those who cultivate it.</p>
            <p>This mind map breaks down Newport's framework: first understanding <strong>why deep work matters</strong> (The Idea), then learning <strong>how to actually do it</strong> (The Rules). Each chapter offers practical strategies for training your mind to focus and producing work that matters.</p>

            <h3>Core Teachings of Deep Work</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Deep Work Hypothesis:</strong> The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill will thrive.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Quality Work = Time × Intensity:</strong> The key to producing elite-level work is to spend more consecutive hours in a state of high concentration.</li>
                <li><strong>Attention Residue:</strong> When you switch from Task A to Task B, your attention doesn't immediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about Task A. This residue is especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity.</li>
                <li><strong>The Principle of Least Resistance:</strong> In the absence of clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors, we tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment—even if they undermine our long-term goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Busyness as Proxy for Productivity:</strong> In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive, many knowledge workers turn back toward busyness as a proxy—doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.</li>
                <li><strong>The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:</strong> Identify the core factors that determine success in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts substantially outweigh its negative impacts.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Comfortable with Boredom:</strong> If every moment of potential boredom is relieved with a glance at your smartphone, your brain has been rewired to the point where it's not ready for deep work.</li>
                <li><strong>Shutdown Complete:</strong> End your workday with a shutdown ritual that ensures every incomplete task has been reviewed and captured. This frees your mind and allows proper recovery.</li>
            </ul>
