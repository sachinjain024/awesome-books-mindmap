— Tiago Forte</p>

<h2>The Art of Selective Capture</h2>
<p>The first step of CODE is Capture — but Forte is emphatic that capture does not mean saving everything. The instinct to be comprehensive is one of the most common and destructive mistakes people make when building a Second Brain.</p>
<p>If you try to save everything, you create a digital landfill. No one benefits from a system so cluttered that finding anything useful requires digging through mountains of irrelevant material. The goal is a curated collection, not an archive.</p>
<p>The secret to effective capture is <strong>selectivity guided by resonance</strong>. You are looking for the ideas, passages, and observations that make you feel something — curiosity, excitement, surprise, recognition. These are the signals that something is worth preserving.</p>
<h3 class="code-box">What Deserves to Be Captured</h3>
<p>Forte identifies four types of content that typically deserve capture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inspiring:</strong> Ideas that inspire you and make you think differently</li>
<li><strong>Useful:</strong> Information you’ll need for a specific project or goal</li>
<li><strong>Personal:</strong> Notes from your own thinking — journal entries, reflections, realizations</li>
<li><strong>Surprising:</strong> Things that challenge your assumptions or shift your worldview</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that “comprehensive” is not on this list. You are not building an encyclopedia. You are building a personal intellectual toolkit.</p>
<h2>The Capture Tools Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Capture happens across many contexts and requires different tools for different situations:</p>
<h3 class="technique-box">Reading</h3>
<p>When reading books (physical or digital), highlight sparingly. Aim for the single most valuable sentence on a page, not the entire paragraph. For digital books, export highlights to your note-taking app directly. For physical books, transcribe the key highlights.</p>
<p>For articles and web content, tools like Readwise, Instapaper, or browser extensions can send highlights directly to your note app.</p>
<h3>Listening</h3>
<p>Podcasts and audiobooks are rich sources of ideas that most people lose entirely. While listening, pause to capture key ideas as voice memos or text notes. The friction of doing this is itself a filter — you’ll only stop for the ideas that genuinely matter.</p>
<h3>Watching</h3>
<p>Videos, lectures, and films can be captured by pausing and writing a brief note, or by enabling automatic transcripts where available and copying key passages.</p>
<h3>Thinking</h3>
<p>Some of your best captures will come from your own mind — a shower thought, a realization during a walk, an idea that arrives while driving. Keep a simple capture tool within reach at all times (a notes app on your phone). The idea that you’ll remember it later is almost always wrong.</p>
<h2>The Capture Criteria</h2>
<p>When in doubt about whether to save something, Forte recommends asking: <strong>“Would my future self find this useful?”</strong> This simple question shifts your perspective from the present moment (where everything might seem interesting) to a future context (where specific usefulness matters most).</p>
<p>A more refined set of criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this relate to a <strong>current project</strong> I’m working on?</li>
<li>Does this relate to an <strong>ongoing area</strong> of responsibility?</li>
<li>Is this a piece of <strong>inspiration</strong> that excites me right now?</li>
<li>Is this <strong>surprising</strong> — does it challenge what I thought I knew?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can answer yes to any of these, save it. If not, let it go.</p>
<h3 class="insight-box">The 12 Favorite Problems</h3>
<p>Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman maintained a list of his “twelve favorite problems” — questions he was perpetually curious about. Whenever he encountered a new insight, he’d ask whether it shed light on any of his twelve problems. If it did, he captured it. If not, he let it pass.</p>
<p>Forte recommends a similar practice. Keep a list of your own favorite open questions — things you’re persistently curious about. Use them as a filter for what’s worth capturing. This turns your capture practice from random to purposeful.</p>
<h2>Common Capture Mistakes</h2>
<h3 class="technique-box">Over-Capturing</h3>
<p>Saving indiscriminately creates noise that drowns out the signal. If you’ve ever faced a note-taking app with thousands of unorganized items and felt paralyzed, you’ve experienced the cost of over-capturing.</p>
<p><strong>The fix:</strong> Apply the resonance filter ruthlessly. If you’re not sure whether to save something, don’t.</p>
<h3>Under-Capturing</h3>
<p>At the other extreme, some people are so cautious about clogging their system that they save almost nothing. After a month, their Second Brain is empty and useless.</p>
<p><strong>The fix:</strong> Capture more generously than you think you should at first. You can always prune later. But you cannot retrieve what you never saved.</p>
<h3>Saving Without Context</h3>
<p>A bare link or a passage with no context is nearly useless when you return to it six months later. Always add a brief note about <em>why</em> you saved something.</p>
<p><strong>The fix:</strong> Spend 10 seconds adding a sentence: “Saved because it applies to the X project” or “Useful example of Y concept.”</p>
<h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>What are your twelve favorite problems — the questions you find yourself returning to again and again? Write them down. These become your personal capture filter, turning a random collection into a purposeful curation.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Capture is the first step of CODE, but it does not mean saving everything — selectivity is essential</li>
<li>The resonance filter — saving what makes you feel something — is the most important capture criterion</li>
<li>Capture happens across tools: reading highlights, voice memos, note apps, and your own thinking</li>
<li>Ask “Would my future self find this useful?” to filter captures in the moment</li>
<li>The Twelve Favorite Problems technique turns capture from random to purposeful</li>
<li>Always add brief context when saving — a sentence about <em>why</em> makes notes infinitely more valuable</li>
