<p>“Your notes should be organized not by where they came from, but by where they are going.”
— Tiago Forte</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Problem with Traditional Organization</h2>
<p>Most people organize their files and notes the same way they organize their bookshelves — by topic or category. All the marketing notes go in a Marketing folder. All the health notes go in a Health folder. This seems intuitive, but it creates a fundamental problem: <strong>when you need information for a project, you have to search across multiple topics.</strong></p>
<p>Forte’s breakthrough insight — and arguably the most original contribution of the entire book — is to organize information not by topic but by <strong>actionability</strong>. Where will you need this? When will you use it? The answer to those questions, not the subject matter of the content, determines where a note belongs.</p>
<h2>The PARA Method</h2>
<p>PARA is a four-category system that covers everything in your digital life:</p>
<h3 class="para-box">Projects</h3>
<p><strong>Short-term efforts with a specific goal and deadline.</strong></p>
<p>Examples: “Write Q3 marketing report,” “Plan anniversary trip,” “Launch podcast,” “Read <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>”</p>
<p>Projects are active — they have an end state, and you’re working toward it right now. This is the highest-priority category in PARA. Information relevant to a current project gets immediate access here.</p>
<p><strong>Key test:</strong> Does it have a deadline? Does it have a clear definition of done?</p>
<h3 class="para-box">Areas</h3>
<p><strong>Long-term responsibilities you want to maintain over time.</strong></p>
<p>Examples: “Health,” “Finances,” “Relationships,” “Professional development,” “Home management”</p>
<p>Areas don’t have end dates — they are ongoing. You don’t “finish” your health or your finances. But you do need to maintain standards in these areas over time. Notes in Areas are things you’ll reference regularly as you tend to these responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Key test:</strong> Is there a standard you want to maintain? Does it go on indefinitely?</p>
<h3 class="para-box">Resources</h3>
<p><strong>Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.</strong></p>
<p>Examples: “Productivity research,” “Copywriting techniques,” “Architecture inspiration,” “Recipes,” “Language learning”</p>
<p>Resources are your intellectual interests — things you find fascinating even if you’re not actively using them right now. This is the “library” section of your Second Brain. It grows over time and becomes valuable in unexpected ways.</p>
<p><strong>Key test:</strong> Is it something you find interesting but aren’t actively using?</p>
<h3 class="para-box">Archives</h3>
<p><strong>Inactive items from the other three categories.</strong></p>
<p>When a project is completed, it moves to Archives. When an area of life becomes less relevant (a job you’ve left, a home you’ve sold), it moves to Archives. Archives preserve your history without cluttering your active workspace.</p>
<p><strong>Key test:</strong> Is it finished, abandoned, or no longer relevant?</p>
<h2>Why PARA Works</h2>
<p>The power of PARA lies in its alignment with your actual life. When you open your Second Brain to find information for a project, you go directly to the Projects folder. When you’re doing your monthly health check-in, you go to Areas. When you’re curious about a topic, you browse Resources. When you need to reference something from three years ago, you search Archives.</p>
<h3 class="code-box">The Hierarchy of Actionability</h3>
<p>PARA is ordered by actionability:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Projects</strong> — most actionable (active right now)</li>
<li><strong>Areas</strong> — moderately actionable (ongoing, but not urgent)</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> — potentially actionable (for future reference)</li>
<li><strong>Archives</strong> — least actionable (for historical reference)</li>
</ol>
<p>When you capture something new, you ask: “Is this related to an active project?” If yes → Projects. If no, “Is this related to an ongoing area?” If yes → Areas. And so on. The decision is always quick and action-oriented.</p>
<h2>Moving Information Through PARA</h2>
<p>PARA is not a static system — information flows through it as your life changes. A topic in Resources might become a Project when you decide to act on it. A completed Project moves to Archives. An Area might become irrelevant (and move to Archives) if your circumstances change.</p>
<p>This fluidity is a feature, not a bug. PARA reflects the actual shape of your life at any given moment, which is why it stays useful over years rather than becoming an overgrown mess.</p>
<h3 class="technique-box">Practical Example</h3>
<p>You read an article about negotiation techniques and save a few key passages. Where do they go?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you have an active salary negotiation coming up:</strong> → Projects (“Salary Negotiation 2024”)</li>
<li><strong>If negotiation is an ongoing skill you’re developing:</strong> → Areas (“Professional Development”) or Resources (“Negotiation”)</li>
<li><strong>If it’s just interesting:</strong> → Resources (“Communication Skills”)</li>
</ul>
<p>The same content could belong in different places depending on your current context. The system adapts to you, not the other way around.</p>
<h2>One System Across All Tools</h2>
<p>A key PARA principle is that this structure should be mirrored across all your digital tools — your note-taking app, your cloud storage, your task manager, even your email. When every tool uses the same four-category structure, cognitive load drops dramatically. You always know where to look, regardless of which tool you’re in.</p>
<h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>Open your current digital filing system — wherever you store notes, files, and documents. How is it organized? Does the organization reflect your active projects and responsibilities, or does it reflect a system you set up years ago that no longer matches your life?</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Traditional topic-based organization fails because it separates information from action</li>
<li>PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) organizes information by actionability — where you’ll need it</li>
<li>Projects are active efforts with deadlines; Areas are ongoing responsibilities; Resources are interests; Archives are inactive items</li>
<li>Information flows through PARA as your life changes — the system is dynamic, not static</li>
<li>Apply PARA consistently across all your digital tools to create one unified system</li>
<li>The organizing question is always: “Where will I need this when I need it?”</li>
</ul>
