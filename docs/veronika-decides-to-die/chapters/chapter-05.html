<h2>Waking Up</h2>
<p>Veronika opens her eyes. White ceiling. Sterile smell. The soft beep of medical equipment. This is not what death looks like.</p>
<p>She's alive. The realization hits like a physical blow. She tried to die—took enough pills to kill herself twice over—and somehow, impossibly, she's alive.</p>
<p>Confusion gives way to rage. She wanted to die. She chose to die. She had every right to end her own meaningless existence. And someone—some interfering stranger—saved her. Denied her the one authentic choice she'd made.</p>
<p>A nurse enters, checks her vital signs, says something Veronika doesn't quite hear. The fury builds. She didn't ask to be saved. She didn't want to wake up in this hospital bed, back in the world she'd chosen to leave.</p>
<h3>The First Emotion {.awakening-box}</h3>
<p>But beneath the rage, something else stirs. Surprise. She's feeling something. Real, intense, uncomplicated rage. Not the dull emptiness that characterized her life before. Not the numbness that drove her to suicide.</p>
<p>Actual emotion. As real and visceral as the hatred she felt reading that magazine article about Slovenia. Maybe more real, because it's directed at something that matters: her own stolen death.</p>
<p>The irony doesn't escape her. She tried to die because she felt nothing. Now that she's alive, she feels everything—fury, betrayal, frustration. All the emotions that were absent before are flooding through her now.</p>
<h2>Enter Dr. Igor</h2>
<p>A middle-aged man in a white coat enters. Dr. Igor Gregorovich, head psychiatrist at Villete mental hospital. He carries a clipboard and wears the expression of someone about to deliver difficult news.</p>
<p>Veronika prepares for the lecture. The psychiatrist will explain why she needs help, why suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems, why she has so much to live for. She's ready to tune him out.</p>
<p>But Dr. Igor doesn't lecture. Instead, he delivers a different kind of news entirely.</p>
<h3>The Diagnosis {.death-box}</h3>
<p>&quot;The suicide attempt damaged your heart,&quot; he says calmly, clinically. &quot;The overdose caused a severe cardiovascular incident. While we saved your life, we couldn't prevent all the damage.&quot;</p>
<p>Veronika stares at him, not comprehending.</p>
<p>&quot;You have perhaps five days,&quot; Dr. Igor continues. &quot;Maybe a week at most. Your heart will stop, and there's nothing we can do to prevent it. The damage is irreversible.&quot;</p>
<p>The words don't make sense at first. She's alive but dying? Saved but condemned? What kind of cruel joke is this?</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to die,&quot; Veronika says, her voice hoarse. &quot;You should have let me die.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're doctors,&quot; Dr. Igor replies. &quot;We save lives. That's what we do.&quot; He pauses, studying her. &quot;But we couldn't save you completely. The pills succeeded, just not immediately. You'll die, Veronika. Just not today.&quot;</p>
<h2>The Cruel Irony</h2>
<p>Veronika tries to process this information. She attempted suicide to escape life. She was saved from suicide. But she's going to die anyway, slowly, over the next several days.</p>
<p>It's the worst possible outcome. She doesn't get the quick, peaceful death she wanted. Instead, she gets an extended dying process, trapped in a mental hospital, surrounded by people who think they saved her when they've actually condemned her to a slower, more agonizing end.</p>
<p>The universe's sense of humor is vicious.</p>
<p>She wanted to die on her terms. Now she'll die on the universe's terms. The control she sought through suicide has been taken from her completely. She's not choosing death anymore—death is choosing her, at its own pace, in its own time.</p>
<h3>The Shock Sets In {.vitriol-box}</h3>
<p>Dr. Igor leaves her with this information. No comfort, no false hope, just cold medical facts. Five days. Maybe a week. Then her damaged heart will simply stop.</p>
<p>Veronika lies in the hospital bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to feel something about this news. Relief? Fear? Anger? Acceptance?</p>
<p>Instead, she feels that strange awakening again. The same visceral aliveness she felt in her rage moments before. Her heart is failing, yes. But somehow, knowing she's dying—really dying, inevitably dying—makes her feel more alive than she's felt in years.</p>
<p>This isn't the numbness she felt before her suicide attempt. This is sharp, clear, painful awareness. She's going to die. Not someday in some abstract future, but soon. Days, not decades. Her time is measured now, finite, countable.</p>
<h2>Living While Dying</h2>
<p>The paradox settles over her. She tried to kill herself because life felt meaningless. Now she's dying whether she wants to or not, and suddenly life feels... different. Not meaningful exactly. But not empty either.</p>
<p>She's in a mental hospital. Condemned to die within days. Surrounded by people society has labeled insane. This should be her worst nightmare.</p>
<p>Instead, it's almost liberating. She has nothing left to lose. No future to protect, no reputation to maintain, no normal life to return to. The expectations that weighed on her before—be productive, be happy, be normal—all irrelevant now.</p>
<h3>A Strange Freedom {.life-lesson}</h3>
<p>What does someone do when they have only days to live? What matters when nothing matters anymore?</p>
<p>Veronika doesn't have answers yet. But for the first time in longer than she can remember, she's actually curious about something. About what will happen next. About how she'll spend these final days. About who she'll meet in this strange place called Villete.</p>
<p>She wanted death to end the questions. Instead, death—real, imminent death—has made her start asking them again.</p>
<p>Dr. Igor's diagnosis should be devastating. It is devastating. But it's also, strangely, the most interesting thing that's happened to her in years.</p>
<p>She's dying. Really dying. And somehow, for reasons she doesn't fully understand, this makes her feel more alive than she's felt since she can remember.</p>
<h2>The First Day</h2>
<p>Veronika spends the rest of that first day in a strange mental state. Not quite despair, not quite hope. Something in between. Something new.</p>
<p>She observes the hospital. The other patients. The staff. The rhythms of life in Villete. Everything has a surreal quality, like she's watching a film about someone else's life.</p>
<p>But it's her life. Her last days of life. And despite everything—despite the failed suicide, the damaged heart, the inevitable approaching death—she's paying attention now.</p>
<h3>Reflection {.reflection}</h3>
<p>Before, she was alive but didn't notice. Didn't care. Let days blur into each other in an endless, meaningless stream. Now, with only days left, each moment stands out. Each sensation registers. The taste of food. The light through the window. The sounds of the hospital.</p>
<p>She's dying. But she's also, for the first time in years, actually living. Actually experiencing her existence rather than sleepwalking through it.</p>
<p>The irony is not lost on her. It took a death sentence to wake her up to life.</p>
