<h2>The Doctor's Secret</h2>
<p>Dr. Igor has a theory. Not an official one, not published in psychiatric journals, not accepted by his colleagues. A private theory he's been developing for years, tested quietly, unethically, on the patients of Villete.</p>
<p>He calls it the Theory of Vitriol.</p>
<p>Vitriol: medieval Latin for a toxic, corrosive substance. In alchemy, the universal solvent that could dissolve anything. In Dr. Igor's theory, the bitter poison that slowly destroys the human spirit.</p>
<p>Most doctors treat mental illness as brain chemistry gone wrong. Depression, schizophrenia, anxiety—all explained through neurotransmitters, genetic predispositions, chemical imbalances. Fix the chemistry, fix the patient.</p>
<p>Dr. Igor thinks they're missing something fundamental. The real disease isn't in the brain. It's in the soul.</p>
<h3>The Poison of Conformity {.vitriol-box}</h3>
<p>According to Dr. Igor's theory, Vitriol accumulates when people suppress their authentic selves to meet external expectations. Every time you deny who you really are to become who others want you to be, a drop of Vitriol forms in your system.</p>
<p>At first, it's manageable. Everyone conforms sometimes. Social life requires compromise. But when conformity becomes constant, when you spend years or decades living according to others' scripts, the Vitriol builds up.</p>
<p>It poisons everything. Your joy. Your creativity. Your sense of meaning. Your will to live. Eventually, it becomes toxic enough to cause what psychiatrists call &quot;mental illness.&quot;</p>
<p>But Dr. Igor believes the illness isn't mental—it's spiritual. The brain isn't malfunctioning. The soul is being poisoned by a life lived inauthentically.</p>
<p>Depression isn't a chemical imbalance—it's what happens when you spend years denying your true nature.</p>
<p>Anxiety isn't overactive neurons—it's the constant fear of being discovered as someone other than who you pretend to be.</p>
<p>Schizophrenia isn't just genetic bad luck—it's often the ultimate retreat from a world that won't accept your authentic self.</p>
<h2>The Real Madness</h2>
<p>Here's the radical part of Dr. Igor's theory: most people in mental hospitals are saner than the people outside.</p>
<p>The patients at Villete recognized, consciously or unconsciously, that living an inauthentic life was poisoning them. So they stopped. They broke down, withdrew, refused to play along. They chose symptoms over soul death.</p>
<p>Society calls this madness. Dr. Igor calls it honesty.</p>
<p>The real madness, he believes, is outside the hospital walls. The real madness is the collective agreement to deny our authentic selves, suppress our desires, conform to expectations, and call this normal. Call this healthy. Call this success.</p>
<h3>The Conformity Trap {.life-lesson}</h3>
<p>Everyone is a little mad, Dr. Igor theorizes. But most people's madness is acceptable. They're mad in the right way—pursuing careers they hate, maintaining relationships that drain them, living lives that feel meaningless, all while pretending everything is fine.</p>
<p>This madness is invisible because everyone shares it. It's the water we swim in, so we don't notice we're drowning.</p>
<p>But some people can't maintain the pretense. Eduard, who couldn't be a diplomat when he was an artist. Mari, who had a perfect life but felt empty inside. Zedka, who had panic attacks trying to be the perfect wife and mother.</p>
<p>Their madness became visible, unacceptable, diagnosable. So society locked them up.</p>
<p>Not because they're sick, Dr. Igor believes, but because they stopped pretending. Because their Vitriol levels became so toxic that they could no longer maintain the collective illusion of normalcy.</p>
<h2>Veronika's Role</h2>
<p>This is where Veronika enters Dr. Igor's theory—and his experiment.</p>
<p>She attempted suicide not because of mental illness, but because of Vitriol poisoning. She lived an externally perfect life that was internally empty. The conformity required to maintain that perfect life poisoned her until death seemed preferable to continuing.</p>
<p>Her suicide attempt was actually evidence of sanity. She recognized the poison and tried to escape it.</p>
<p>But Dr. Igor saw an opportunity.</p>
<h3>The Unethical Experiment {.death-box}</h3>
<p>Here's what Dr. Igor doesn't tell Veronika initially: her heart is fine. The overdose didn't cause irreversible damage. She's not dying in five days.</p>
<p>He lied.</p>
<p>Why? To test his theory. He wanted to see what would happen when someone freed from the burden of a future—someone with nothing left to lose—finally stopped conforming completely.</p>
<p>Would she become more alive? Would the Vitriol drain from her system? Would she discover her authentic self when external expectations no longer mattered?</p>
<p>It's profoundly unethical. Playing with someone's life, giving them a false death sentence, treating a human being as an experimental subject. Dr. Igor knows this. He justifies it anyway.</p>
<p>For science. For understanding. For potentially helping countless others suffering from Vitriol poisoning who don't even know they're sick.</p>
<p>And because, he admits to himself, he's curious. Curious about what a truly authentic human looks like. Curious about whether freedom from the future can cure what conformity to the past has poisoned.</p>
<h2>The Mechanism</h2>
<p>Dr. Igor explains his theory to his notes, if not yet to Veronika: Vitriol forms at the intersection of awareness and conformity.</p>
<p>Animals don't get depressed (not in the human sense) because they live authentically. They don't pretend to be anything other than what they are. A wolf is always a wolf. It doesn't suppress its wolfness to please other wolves.</p>
<p>Children rarely suffer Vitriol poisoning. They're authentic by default. They cry when sad, laugh when happy, say what they think. The Vitriol comes later, when they learn to conform.</p>
<p>Adults accumulate Vitriol throughout their lives. With each suppressed desire, each authentic impulse denied, each moment of pretending to be someone they're not, the poison builds.</p>
<h3>The Cure {.awakening-box}</h3>
<p>Is there a cure for Vitriol poisoning? Dr. Igor believes there is, though it's difficult and radical.</p>
<p>Stop conforming. Live authentically. Be exactly who you are, regardless of external expectations or social consequences.</p>
<p>Easier said than done. Most people are so invested in their inauthentic lives that they can't imagine alternatives. Their careers, relationships, identities—all built on conformity. To stop would mean losing everything.</p>
<p>But what are they really losing? Dr. Igor asks. Lives they don't want? Relationships that drain them? Identities that feel false?</p>
<p>The cure requires courage. The courage to disappoint others. The courage to fail by conventional standards. The courage to be labeled crazy for refusing to participate in collective madness.</p>
<p>Most people can't do it. Can't risk it. So the Vitriol continues to accumulate, slowly poisoning them, until they end up depressed, anxious, suicidal, or in Villete.</p>
<h2>Veronika as Guinea Pig</h2>
<p>Veronika doesn't know she's part of this experiment. She thinks she's dying. That belief is the treatment.</p>
<p>If you truly have only days to live, conformity becomes irrelevant. Career? Doesn't matter. Reputation? Meaningless. Others' expectations? Who cares—you'll be dead.</p>
<p>This freedom should be terrifying. Instead, Dr. Igor observes, it's liberating. Veronika is becoming more alive as she approaches her (fake) death. More present, more authentic, more engaged.</p>
<p>She's playing piano again. Connecting with Eduard. Experiencing real emotions. Living fully in each moment because she believes those moments are limited.</p>
<h3>The Ethical Question {.reflection}</h3>
<p>Dr. Igor knows what he's doing is wrong. Lying to a patient. Creating psychological trauma. Manipulating someone for experimental purposes.</p>
<p>But he also sees the results. Veronika is transforming. The emptiness that drove her to suicide is being replaced by aliveness. The Vitriol is draining from her system.</p>
<p>Not because of medication. Not because of therapy. But because she believes she's dying, and that belief has freed her from the conformity that was killing her slowly.</p>
<p>Does the end justify the means? Dr. Igor isn't sure. But he continues the experiment anyway.</p>
<p>Because if he's right—if Vitriol is the real disease and authenticity is the cure—then maybe this unethical experiment could save countless lives.</p>
<p>Or maybe he's just a curious doctor playing God with a suicidal patient's psychology. Maybe his theory is nonsense and he's just causing harm.</p>
<p>He doesn't know yet. Won't know until Veronika's transformation is complete. Until he reveals the truth and sees whether she chooses life or death when both options are real again.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
