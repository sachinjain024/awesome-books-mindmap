<h2>The Count</h2>
<p>Twenty-four hours. Maybe less. Dr. Igor's latest examination confirms what Veronika already knows: her damaged heart is approaching its limit. Tomorrow, maybe the day after, it will simply stop.</p>
<p>She's lived with this knowledge for days now. But knowing it intellectually and feeling it viscerally are different things. Now, with the end so close she can almost touch it, the reality settles over her like a weight.</p>
<p>This is her last day. These are her last hours. Everything she does from this moment forward is for the final time.</p>
<p>Strange how this thought changes things. Yesterday's piano playing felt exploratory, experimental. Today's will be farewell. Yesterday's conversations with Eduard felt like the beginning of something. Today they feel like closure.</p>
<p>Death has been abstract, approaching but distant. Now it's here. In the room with her. Counting down with every heartbeat.</p>
<h3>The Shift in Perspective {.death-box}</h3>
<p>Veronika notices how her perception has changed. The hospital room, which felt like a prison when she first woke here, now feels almost precious. The sunlight through the window. The distant sounds of other patients. The smell of institutional food.</p>
<p>All of it—everything she would have dismissed as mundane, meaningless, forgettable—now seems significant. Worth noticing. Worth experiencing fully because these experiences are ending.</p>
<p>Is this what living fully means? Appreciating the ordinary because you know it won't last? Finding meaning not in grand moments but in simple ones—sunlight, breath, presence?</p>
<p>If so, she's been doing it wrong her entire life. Taking everything for granted. Waiting for something extraordinary to make life worth living. Missing the extraordinary nature of simply being alive.</p>
<h2>Eduard's Proposal</h2>
<p>Eduard finds her in the common room. He's been speaking more lately—still not much, still mostly silent, but occasional words slip through his self-imposed isolation.</p>
<p>Today he speaks clearly: &quot;We should leave.&quot;</p>
<p>Veronika looks at him, confused. &quot;Leave where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Villete. The hospital. We should escape.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Plan {.awakening-box}</h3>
<p>Eduard explains his thinking, haltingly, using more words than she's heard from him in all their time together. He knows she's dying. Everyone knows—it's not a secret. Dr. Igor has been clear about her prognosis.</p>
<p>But if she's dying anyway, why die here? Why spend her last hours in this hospital, following rules, staying in her assigned room, dying in an institutional bed?</p>
<p>They could leave. Not to save her—there's no saving her damaged heart. But to give her something else. Freedom. Choice. The ability to spend her final hours however she wants, wherever she wants.</p>
<p>It's madness, of course. They're psychiatric patients. Leaving without permission is technically illegal. Eduard would face consequences when he returns. If he returns.</p>
<p>But what's madness in this context? Following rules in her last hours? Or breaking them to claim some small piece of autonomy before the end?</p>
<h2>The Real Question</h2>
<p>Eduard's proposal forces Veronika to confront something she's been avoiding: what does she want from her remaining time?</p>
<p>When she took those sleeping pills, she wanted nothingness. Oblivion. An end to consciousness and the emptiness it contained. Death was preferable to life because life felt meaningless.</p>
<p>But these past days in Villete have been different. Not meaningless exactly. Strange, yes. Difficult. Surreal. But not empty.</p>
<p>Playing piano. Connecting with Eduard. Experiencing real emotions—anger, curiosity, even joy. Learning about Vitriol and authenticity and the madness of conformity.</p>
<h3>What She's Discovered {.life-lesson}</h3>
<p>If she's honest with herself, Veronika has to admit: she doesn't want to die anymore.</p>
<p>Not because her circumstances have improved. She's still in a mental hospital. Her heart is still failing. Death is still approaching. Nothing external has changed.</p>
<p>But something internal has shifted. The emptiness that drove her to suicide has been replaced by... something else. Not happiness exactly. Not contentment. But aliveness. Presence. Engagement with her own existence.</p>
<p>She's been more alive in these dying days than she was in all the years before. The irony is profound and bitter. She found reasons to live just in time to die.</p>
<p>So Eduard's question becomes crucial: how does she want to spend these final hours? In safety and conformity, following hospital rules, dying predictably? Or in freedom and risk, making her own choices, dying on her own terms?</p>
<h2>The Decision</h2>
<p>Veronika makes her choice: they'll leave. Not escape exactly—they're not running from anything. But departure. Walking out. Claiming agency over her final hours.</p>
<p>Eduard smiles. It's the first real smile she's seen from him. Not withdrawn artist, not diagnosed schizophrenic, but young man sharing an adventure with someone who understands.</p>
<p>They plan it for nighttime. When the hospital is quieter, the staff less attentive. They're not prisoners exactly, but leaving would raise questions, cause complications. Better to slip out unnoticed.</p>
<p>Veronika feels something she hasn't felt since before her suicide attempt: anticipation. Excitement, even. Not about what they'll do—there's not much to do with a failing heart and limited time. But about the choice itself. The agency. The refusal to be passive even in death.</p>
<h3>Not to Safety, But to Freedom {.vitriol-box}</h3>
<p>Eduard makes this clear: he's not offering escape to somewhere safe. There is no safety for Veronika anymore. Her heart will fail whether she's in Villete or outside it.</p>
<p>What he's offering is freedom. The freedom to choose. To decide. To live authentically in her remaining hours rather than dying according to institutional schedules and medical protocols.</p>
<p>It's the opposite of her suicide attempt. Then, she was fleeing life because it felt meaningless. Now, she's embracing life—what's left of it—precisely because it's meaningful. Precious. Limited.</p>
<p>She tried to end her story on her terms and failed. Now, at the actual end, she gets another chance. Not to choose death—that's chosen for her. But to choose how she meets it. Passively in a hospital bed? Or actively, consciously, on her own terms?</p>
<p>The choice is obvious.</p>
<h2>Preparing for Departure</h2>
<p>They make simple preparations. Veronika can't carry much—her damaged heart limits physical exertion. Eduard packs a small bag. Nothing elaborate. They're not running away. Just stepping outside.</p>
<p>The other patients notice something is happening but don't interfere. Zedka, who's been observing Veronika's transformation, gives a knowing nod. Mari watches with something like approval. The staff, busy with evening routines, don't notice.</p>
<p>Dr. Igor is in his office, making notes about Veronika's case. His experiment is reaching its conclusion. Tomorrow he planned to reveal the truth. To tell her the heart damage was exaggerated, the death sentence a lie, the whole experience a test of his Vitriol theory.</p>
<p>He doesn't know his subject is about to leave. Doesn't know his carefully controlled experiment is about to become something else entirely.</p>
<h3>The Last Evening in Villete {.reflection}</h3>
<p>Veronika plays piano one more time. Her final performance. Not for an audience—just for herself. For Eduard. For the simple joy of making music with nothing left to prove and nothing left to lose.</p>
<p>The notes are imperfect. The piano is still out of tune. Her technique is rusty from years of neglect. But the music is real. Authentic. True.</p>
<p>This is what living feels like, she realizes. Not perfect moments but real ones. Not achieving something but experiencing something. Not proving your worth but simply being, fully and completely, exactly as you are.</p>
<p>Eduard paints while she plays. His last painting in Villete. It shows two figures—recognizable as Veronika and himself—walking through an open door. Not fleeing. Not escaping. Just walking forward into unknown space.</p>
<p>Into whatever comes next.</p>
<h2>The Moment</h2>
<p>Night falls. The hospital quiets. The moment arrives.</p>
<p>Eduard offers his hand. Veronika takes it. Together, they walk through the corridors of Villete. Past the common room where they first connected. Past Dr. Igor's office where her death sentence was pronounced. Past the room where she woke up after her failed suicide.</p>
<p>Past all of it. Toward the door. Toward freedom. Toward whatever her remaining hours hold.</p>
<p>No one stops them. Maybe no one notices. Or maybe those who notice understand that some journeys must be made, some choices must be honored, even when—especially when—they don't make conventional sense.</p>
<p>They reach the exit. Eduard opens the door. Cold night air rushes in. The world outside Villete awaits—the same world Veronika tried to leave, now precious precisely because she's leaving it soon.</p>
<p>She steps through. Not to death—death is coming anyway. But to life. To the fullest, most authentic experience of her remaining moments.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours or less. But they're hers. Finally, truly hers.</p>
