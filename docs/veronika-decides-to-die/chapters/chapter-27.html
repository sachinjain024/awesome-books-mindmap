            <blockquote>
<p>&quot;One day you will wake up and there won't be any more time to do the things you've always wanted. Do it now.&quot;
— Paulo Coelho</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Morning Light</h2>
<p>Veronika opens her eyes. Sunlight streams through unfamiliar windows. She's in Eduard's arms. They're in a small apartment outside Villete—his family's property, barely used, but available.</p>
<p>She expected to wake up dead. Or not wake up at all. Her last clear memory is lying down next to Eduard, heart hammering erratically, convinced these were her final moments. Convinced she was dying.</p>
<p>But here she is. Awake. Breathing. Alive.</p>
<p>Confusion first. Then awareness. Then something that feels like disappointment mixed with relief mixed with terror.</p>
<p>She's still alive. Her heart didn't stop. She made it through the night.</p>
<h3>The Impossible Morning {.awakening-box}</h3>
<p>This shouldn't be possible. Dr. Igor was clear. Twenty-four hours, maybe less. Her heart was failing, damaged irreversibly by the overdose. Death was inevitable, imminent, certain.</p>
<p>Yet she's here. Heart still beating. Body still functioning. More than functioning—she feels... good. Not weak or fading. Not like someone on death's doorstep.</p>
<p>She feels alive. Genuinely, vitally alive.</p>
<p>Eduard wakes beside her. He sees the confusion on her face and understands immediately. This wasn't supposed to happen. She was supposed to die last night. They were living her final hours.</p>
<p>But morning came. And she's still here.</p>
<p>&quot;We should go back,&quot; Eduard says quietly. &quot;To Villete. We need to talk to Dr. Igor.&quot;</p>
<h2>Return to Villete</h2>
<p>They walk back through Ljubljana's morning streets. The city is waking up—people heading to work, shops opening, normal life proceeding normally.</p>
<p>Veronika observes it all with strange intensity. She's seen this city a thousand times. Lived here her whole life. But she's never really seen it before. Not like this. Not with this clarity.</p>
<p>Everything is vivid. The morning light. The cold air. The sound of traffic. The smell of coffee from cafes. All of it so ordinary, so mundane, so profoundly beautiful.</p>
<p>She's alive. Against all expectations, against medical certainty, she's alive. And the world looks completely different.</p>
<h3>The Walk Back {.life-lesson}</h3>
<p>They don't hurry. If her heart was going to fail, it would have failed last night. Something has changed. Something Dr. Igor needs to explain.</p>
<p>Eduard holds her hand as they walk. He's been speaking more frequently now. The silent, withdrawn schizophrenic is becoming someone else. Someone present. Someone engaged with the world beyond his internal landscape.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm leaving Villete,&quot; he tells her. &quot;Really leaving. Going back to painting. Not as my family wants. As I want. As I am.&quot;</p>
<p>Veronika understands. Whatever happened to her, something similar happened to him. The time in Villete, the connection with her, the realization that conformity is madness—it's freed something in him.</p>
<p>He's choosing authenticity over approval. Art over duty. Himself over expectations.</p>
<p>The schizophrenia—his retreat from an unacceptable world—is ending. Not because the world changed. Because he did.</p>
<h2>Dr. Igor's Office</h2>
<p>They find Dr. Igor in his office, reviewing notes. He looks up when they enter. Sees Veronika. Shows the briefest flicker of surprise before his clinical mask returns.</p>
<p>&quot;You're alive,&quot; he observes.</p>
<p>&quot;You said I would be dead by now,&quot; Veronika responds. &quot;You said my heart was damaged. Irreversibly. That I had days to live.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Igor sets down his papers. Studies her. Then Eduard. Then back to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Sit down,&quot; he says. &quot;There's something I need to tell you.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Confession {.vitriol-box}</h3>
<p>Dr. Igor explains. Everything. The Theory of Vitriol. His unethical experiment. The lie about her heart damage.</p>
<p>&quot;Your overdose caused some cardiovascular stress,&quot; he admits. &quot;But nothing irreversible. Nothing fatal. Your heart is fine. Was always fine. You were never dying.&quot;</p>
<p>The words don't immediately make sense to Veronika. She processes them slowly, carefully, trying to understand what he's saying.</p>
<p>Her heart is fine. She wasn't dying. The death sentence was fake. A lie. An experiment.</p>
<p>She should feel rage. Betrayal. Horror at this violation. And part of her does. He lied to her. Manipulated her. Played with her psychology for his own scientific curiosity.</p>
<p>But another part—a larger part—feels something else entirely.</p>
<h2>The Transformation</h2>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; she asks. &quot;Why lie to me?&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Igor explains his theory. How Vitriol poisons people living inauthentically. How conformity creates the emptiness that drove her to suicide. How he wanted to test whether freedom from the future could cure what pressure from the past had poisoned.</p>
<p>&quot;You attempted suicide because you felt nothing,&quot; he says. &quot;Because life seemed meaningless. Because the days stretched out endlessly with no purpose, no joy, no reason to continue.&quot;</p>
<p>Veronika can't argue. That's exactly why she took those pills.</p>
<p>&quot;But when you believed you were dying,&quot; Dr. Igor continues, &quot;you started living. Really living. Experiencing moments fully. Connecting authentically. Finding meaning not in some distant future but in the immediate present.&quot;</p>
<h3>The Cruel Kindness {.death-box}</h3>
<p>It's true. Veronika knows it's true. These past days, believing she was dying, she's been more alive than in all the years before. The emptiness disappeared. The meaninglessness vanished. Life became precious precisely because it was ending.</p>
<p>&quot;So what now?&quot; she asks. &quot;Now that I know I'm not dying? Now that the future is back? Do I go back to feeling nothing? Back to the emptiness that made death preferable to life?&quot;</p>
<p>This is the real question. The crucial one. Dr. Igor's experiment isn't complete until he knows the answer.</p>
<p>Will Veronika, armed with the knowledge that she's healthy, that she has a future, that death isn't imminent—will she choose life? Or will the emptiness return?</p>
<p>Will the lesson stick? Or will it disappear now that the threat is removed?</p>
<h2>The Choice</h2>
<p>Veronika sits in silence, processing everything. The lie. The truth. The transformation. The question.</p>
<p>She thinks about these past days. Playing piano. Connecting with Eduard. Experiencing real emotions. Living fully because she thought she was dying.</p>
<p>She thinks about her life before. The emptiness. The conformity. The feeling that nothing mattered. The suicide attempt.</p>
<p>She thinks about this morning. Walking through Ljubljana. Seeing the world with new eyes. Holding Eduard's hand. Being alive.</p>
<h3>The Real Death Sentence {.reflection}</h3>
<p>Here's what Veronika realizes: Dr. Igor was right about one thing. She was dying before. Not her heart—her soul. Slowly poisoned by Vitriol, by living inauthentically, by conforming to expectations while denying her true self.</p>
<p>The suicide attempt was a symptom, not the disease. The disease was the emptiness. The meaninglessness. The feeling that life wasn't worth living.</p>
<p>And the cure—the actual cure—wasn't believing she was dying. It was living authentically. It was freedom from conformity. It was experiencing life fully instead of sleepwalking through it.</p>
<p>The fake death sentence gave her permission to stop pretending. Stop conforming. Stop living according to others' expectations. Be exactly who she was with nothing left to prove.</p>
<p>But she doesn't need a death sentence for that permission. She can give it to herself. Right now. Today. Every day.</p>
<p>She can choose to live—really live—not because she's dying but because she's alive.</p>
<h2>The Decision</h2>
<p>Veronika looks at Dr. Igor. Then at Eduard. Then back to Dr. Igor.</p>
<p>&quot;What you did was unethical,&quot; she says. &quot;You lied to me. Manipulated me. Treated me like an experimental subject instead of a human being.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Igor nods. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you were also right,&quot; she continues. &quot;About Vitriol. About conformity. About what was killing me. Not some overdose. Me. My own refusal to live authentically. My own submission to emptiness.&quot;</p>
<p>She stands. Eduard stands with her.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm leaving Villete,&quot; she announces. &quot;Not because I'm cured. But because I'm choosing life. Real life. Authentic life. Whatever that looks like.&quot;</p>
<h3>The New Life {.awakening-box}</h3>
<p>She doesn't know what comes next. Maybe she'll go back to her job at the library. Maybe she won't. Maybe she'll pursue music seriously. Maybe she'll do something entirely different.</p>
<p>The future is uncertain. But that's okay. The future was always uncertain. She just spent years pretending otherwise, conforming to a safe, predictable, meaningful path that was actually poisoning her.</p>
<p>Now she's choosing uncertainty. Risk. Authenticity. Living according to her own desires, her own values, her own sense of what matters.</p>
<p>Will it be easy? No. Will others approve? Probably not. Will she sometimes doubt this choice? Almost certainly.</p>
<p>But will it be real? Will it be hers? Will it be alive?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Yes.</p>
<h2>Walking Out</h2>
<p>Veronika and Eduard leave Dr. Igor's office. Leave Villete. Walk out into Ljubljana's morning.</p>
<p>The city looks the same as it did weeks ago, before her suicide attempt. Same buildings, same streets, same people. But everything is different.</p>
<p>She's different. Not saved. Not cured. Not fixed. But transformed. Awakened. Choosing.</p>
<p>Eduard squeezes her hand. He's choosing too. Choosing art over duty. Authenticity over approval. Life over the living death of conformity.</p>
<p>They're both risks. Both uncertain. Both potentially mistakes by conventional measures. But they're theirs. Finally, truly theirs.</p>
<h3>The Beginning {.life-lesson}</h3>
<p>This is where the story ends. Or begins. Depending on perspective.</p>
<p>Veronika tried to die because life felt meaningless. She was saved, lied to, told she was dying anyway. In those final days, she discovered meaning—not in some grand purpose but in simple aliveness, authentic presence, genuine connection.</p>
<p>Now she knows the truth. She's not dying. Her heart is fine. The future stretches ahead, vast and uncertain.</p>
<p>But she's taking the lesson with her. The awareness that life is precious not because it's ending but because it's happening. That meaning comes not from conformity but from authenticity. That the real madness is living as others expect rather than as you truly are.</p>
<p>She tried to decide to die. Failed. And in failing, learned to decide to live.</p>
<p>Not the safe life. Not the empty life. Not the life others scripted for her.</p>
<p>But her life. Real, risky, uncertain, authentic, alive.</p>
<p>Her life.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Veronika wakes up alive and healthy:</strong> against all expectations, she survived the night—her heart didn't fail because it was never failing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dr. Igor confesses his lie:</strong> the heart damage was exaggerated, the death sentence fake—an unethical experiment to test his Theory of Vitriol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The real disease was spiritual, not physical:</strong> she was dying before, slowly poisoned by conformity and inauthenticity, not by overdose damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The fake death sentence cured the real illness:</strong> believing she was dying gave her permission to live authentically, fully, presently—finding meaning in immediate experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The crucial question remains:</strong> now that she knows she's healthy, will she return to emptiness or keep the transformation—can the lesson survive without the threat?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Veronika chooses authentic life:</strong> she leaves Villete not cured but transformed, choosing to live fully, uncertainly, authentically—deciding to live, really live, for the first time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
