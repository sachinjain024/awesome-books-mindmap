            <h2>About This Book</h2>
<p>This mind map presents Charles Darwin’s revolutionary work that introduced the scientific theory of evolution by natural selection. Published in 1859 after over 20 years of research, this book fundamentally changed our understanding of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Darwin meticulously builds his argument through observations from domestication, nature, geology, and biogeography, addressing objections along the way and culminating in a unified theory of descent with modification.</p>
<p>The book proceeds logically: first showing that variation exists (domestication), then that it exists in nature, then that competition for survival is universal, then that this inevitably leads to selection of beneficial traits. Darwin then addresses difficulties, examines instinct and hybridism, consults the geological record, explores geographical distribution, and finally unites all biology under the principle of common descent.</p>

            There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.

            <h3>Core Stoic Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Variation:</strong> Individuals within a species differ from one another in countless ways—no two organisms are exactly alike.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Offspring tend to resemble their parents; variations can be passed down through generations.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Struggle for Existence:</strong> More individuals are born than can survive; resources are limited, creating intense competition.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Natural Selection:</strong> Individuals with beneficial variations survive and reproduce more successfully, passing traits to offspring.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Descent with Modification:</strong> Over vast time, small changes accumulate, producing new varieties and ultimately new species.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Common Ancestry:</strong> All life shares a common origin; species are related through branching descent—the Tree of Life.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Gradualism:</strong> Evolution proceeds through the accumulation of small, successive changes over immense geological time.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Divergence of Character:</strong> Natural selection favors variants that differ most from their ancestors and from each other.</li>
