        <div class="chapter-meta">Part VI: Classification & Conclusion</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Darwin draws his argument to its close. He summarizes the case for natural selection, acknowledges remaining difficulties, and envisions how biology will be transformed by adopting the evolutionary viewpoint. The chapter ends with one of the most celebrated passages in scientific literature—a vision of grandeur in the evolutionary view of life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Recapitulation of the Argument</h2>
            <p>Darwin summarizes the logical structure of his theory:</p>

            <div class="argument-box">
                <h4>The Chain of Reasoning</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Variation exists:</strong> Individuals differ in countless heritable ways</li>
                    <li><strong>Overproduction occurs:</strong> More are born than can survive</li>
                    <li><strong>Struggle for existence follows:</strong> Competition for limited resources</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural selection results:</strong> Favorable variations are preserved</li>
                    <li><strong>Accumulation over time:</strong> Small changes compound into large differences</li>
                    <li><strong>Divergence and extinction:</strong> Lineages branch; intermediates disappear</li>
                    <li><strong>Common descent:</strong> All life shares ancestry, forming a Tree of Life</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>Each step follows from observation and logical necessity. Given the premises, the conclusion is inescapable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Evidence Reviewed</h2>
            <p>Darwin briefly recapitulates the evidence from different fields:</p>

            <div class="observation-box">
                <h4>Converging Lines of Evidence</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Domestic breeding:</strong> Shows the power of selection</li>
                    <li><strong>Geographical distribution:</strong> Explained by descent and dispersal</li>
                    <li><strong>The geological record:</strong> Shows succession and extinction</li>
                    <li><strong>Comparative anatomy:</strong> Reveals homologies from shared ancestry</li>
                    <li><strong>Embryology:</strong> Embryos retain ancestral features</li>
                    <li><strong>Rudimentary organs:</strong> Relics of functional ancestral structures</li>
                    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Reflects genealogical relationships</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Each field, independently studied, points to the same conclusion. The coherence of the evidence from so many directions is itself powerful evidence for the theory.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Difficulties Acknowledged</h2>
            <p>Darwin remains honest about what his theory doesn't yet explain:</p>

            <div class="objection-box">
                <h4>Outstanding Difficulties</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The mechanism of inheritance is unknown</li>
                    <li>The origin of the first life remains mysterious</li>
                    <li>Some complex organs still seem hard to explain</li>
                    <li>The fossil record remains incomplete</li>
                    <li>The age of the Earth may not be sufficient (contemporary physics estimated too young)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Darwin insists these are difficulties, not refutations. Future discoveries may resolve them—and indeed they largely have. Genetics, the discovery of deep time, and countless transitional fossils have all vindicated Darwin's confidence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why the Theory Should Be Adopted</h2>
            <p>Darwin argues for his theory not just because it explains the facts, but because it unifies them:</p>

            <div class="argument-box">
                <h4>The Power of Unification</h4>
                <p>Under the theory of descent with modification:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classification becomes genealogy, not arbitrary grouping</li>
                    <li>Morphology reveals historical connections</li>
                    <li>Embryology shows ancestral stages</li>
                    <li>Geographical distribution reflects history of dispersal</li>
                    <li>Fossils become chapters in the history of life</li>
                    <li>Rudimentary organs become historical relics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What were separate, unconnected facts become parts of a coherent story.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Future of Biology</h2>
            <p>Darwin envisions how evolutionary thinking will transform biology:</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history... how far more interesting, I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become!"
                <div class="attribution">— Charles Darwin</div>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>New Questions to Ask</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the ancestral forms of current species?</li>
                    <li>How did particular adaptations evolve?</li>
                    <li>What are the genealogical relationships among groups?</li>
                    <li>How do embryonic stages reveal evolutionary history?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Evolution provides a framework for understanding—it turns isolated facts into a connected history.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>On the Origin of Man</h2>
            <p>Darwin famously says little about human evolution in this book, but he hints at what's to come:</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."
                <div class="attribution">— Charles Darwin</div>
            </div>

            <p>This single sentence gestures toward the most controversial implication of his theory—that humans, too, are products of evolution, sharing ancestry with other animals. Darwin would develop this in <em>The Descent of Man</em> (1871).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Closing Vision</h2>
            <p>Darwin ends with one of the most beautiful passages in scientific writing:</p>

            <div class="quote-box" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ecfdf5 0%, #d1fae5 100%); border-left-color: #059669;">
                "There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."
                <div class="attribution">— Charles Darwin, final sentence of On the Origin of Species</div>
            </div>

            <p>Darwin transforms what some saw as a degrading materialist theory into a vision of wonder. Life is not diminished by understanding its origins—it is enriched. The "endless forms most beautiful" are all the more remarkable for having arisen through the patient, cumulative work of natural selection over billions of years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The argument for evolution is a logical chain: variation → overproduction → selection → accumulation → descent</li>
                <li>Evidence from multiple independent fields converges on the same conclusion</li>
                <li>Difficulties remain but don't refute the theory—and many have since been resolved</li>
                <li>Evolution unifies biology, transforming isolated facts into connected history</li>
                <li>The evolutionary view opens new questions and deeper understanding</li>
                <li>Human origins are implied, though not elaborated</li>
                <li>"There is grandeur in this view of life"—evolution reveals, not reduces, nature's wonder</li>
            </ul>
