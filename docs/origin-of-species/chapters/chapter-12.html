<p>&quot;On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the same areas, is at once explained.&quot;
— Charles Darwin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darwin continues his exploration of biogeography, now examining freshwater species, oceanic islands, and the remarkable effects of glacial periods. Each pattern he explores reinforces the same conclusion: species distributions are explained by history—by descent, dispersal, and modification—not by independent creation suited to each environment.</p>
<h2>Freshwater Species</h2>
<p>Freshwater habitats present an interesting puzzle: lakes and rivers are isolated from each other, yet freshwater species are often widely distributed.</p>
<h3>The Freshwater Paradox {.observation-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lakes and rivers are separated by land—barriers for aquatic organisms</li>
<li>Yet many freshwater fish, plants, and invertebrates have wide distributions</li>
<li>The same species may occur in disconnected watersheds</li>
</ul>
<p>How do freshwater species disperse across land?</p>
<h3>Mechanisms of Freshwater Dispersal {.example-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flooding:</strong> Rivers occasionally connect during floods</li>
<li><strong>Birds:</strong> Wading birds carry eggs, small organisms, and seeds on feet and feathers</li>
<li><strong>Wind:</strong> Dried ponds leave eggs and seeds that can be blown to new waters</li>
<li><strong>Past connections:</strong> Watersheds that are now separate were once connected</li>
</ul>
<p>Darwin conducted experiments showing that snail eggs, fish eggs, and aquatic plant seeds could survive being dried and later transported.</p>
<h2>Oceanic Islands: Further Evidence</h2>
<p>Darwin elaborates on oceanic islands, which provide crucial evidence for evolution:</p>
<h3>What Oceanic Islands Lack {.observation-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No native land mammals</strong> (except bats, which can fly)</li>
<li><strong>No amphibians</strong> (cannot tolerate salt water)</li>
<li><strong>Often no indigenous freshwater fish</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These are exactly the groups that cannot disperse across oceans. Their absence confirms that island species arrived by dispersal, not by creation in place.</p>
<h3>What Oceanic Islands Have {.observation-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Birds:</strong> Can fly to islands</li>
<li><strong>Insects:</strong> Can be blown by storms</li>
<li><strong>Plants:</strong> Seeds can float or be carried by birds</li>
<li><strong>Reptiles:</strong> Some can survive salt water or rafting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Endemic Species on Islands</h2>
<p>Islands are famous for unique species found nowhere else:</p>
<h3>Endemic Species {.definition-box}</h3>
<p>Species found only in one location. Oceanic islands often have high proportions of endemic species because their isolation allows colonizers to evolve in new directions without competition from continental relatives.</p>
<h3>Why Islands Have Endemics {.argument-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Colonizers arrive and find empty niches</li>
<li>Isolation prevents gene flow with mainland populations</li>
<li>New selective pressures favor novel adaptations</li>
<li>Over time, island populations diverge into distinct species</li>
</ul>
<p>This explains both the uniqueness of island species and their similarity to mainland forms—they're modified descendants of mainland colonizers.</p>
<h2>The Effects of Glacial Periods</h2>
<p>Darwin discusses how ice ages dramatically affected species distributions:</p>
<h3>Glacial Migration {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>During ice ages, arctic species spread southward as temperatures dropped. When glaciers retreated, some populations became isolated on mountaintops—&quot;islands&quot; of cold habitat in a warming world. This explains why similar alpine species occur on disconnected mountain ranges.</p>
<h3>Alpine Species Distribution {.example-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Same or similar species occur on Alps, Pyrenees, and Scandinavian mountains</li>
<li>Similar arctic and alpine floras across northern continents</li>
<li>Mountain peaks harbor relict populations from glacial times</li>
</ul>
<p>This once-puzzling pattern makes perfect sense when viewed historically: species that were once continuous became fragmented as climates changed.</p>
<h2>Analogies Between Isolated Regions</h2>
<p>Darwin notes that isolated regions often show similar patterns of unique forms:</p>
<h3>Parallel Patterns {.observation-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Australia has many endemic species and genera</li>
<li>Madagascar has unique fauna resembling African ancestors but distinct</li>
<li>New Zealand has ancient lineages found nowhere else</li>
<li>Each isolated landmass is a natural experiment in independent evolution</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary: Geography Supports Evolution</h2>
<p>Darwin synthesizes the biogeographic evidence:</p>
<h3>The Case from Geography {.argument-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Distributions are explained by barriers and dispersal, not by suitable environments</li>
<li>Species in each region are related regardless of habitat</li>
<li>Island species resemble nearby mainland forms</li>
<li>Islands lack groups that cannot disperse across oceans</li>
<li>Endemic species result from isolation and divergence</li>
<li>Past climate changes explain current distributions</li>
</ul>
<p>Every one of these patterns follows from evolution and common descent. None is explained by—or even expected from—independent creation.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Freshwater species disperse via floods, birds, and past connections</li>
<li>Oceanic islands lack mammals and amphibians—groups that can't disperse across oceans</li>
<li>Endemic species result from isolation allowing divergence from mainland ancestors</li>
<li>Ice ages explain the current distribution of alpine and arctic species</li>
<li>Each isolated landmass shows independent evolution from ancestral colonizers</li>
<li>Biogeographic patterns are powerful evidence for descent with modification</li>
</ul>
