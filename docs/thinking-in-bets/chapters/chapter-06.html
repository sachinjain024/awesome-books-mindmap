<p>“The most powerful tool for making better decisions is moving your ‘now’ into the future.”
— Annie Duke</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Tyranny of the Present</h2>
<p>Every decision is made in the present moment — but its consequences play out over time. This creates a fundamental tension: the emotions, impulses, and priorities that feel most urgent right now are often the worst guides to decisions that will affect us weeks, months, or years from now.</p>
<p><strong>Temporal discounting</strong> is the name for our tendency to overweight the present and underweight the future. A small reward now feels more compelling than a larger reward later. An immediate pleasure feels more real than a distant consequence. Pain that’s immediate feels more urgent than suffering that’s hypothetical and far away.</p>
<p>This is rational in environments where the future is genuinely uncertain and resources are scarce. In modern life, where long-term planning is both possible and valuable, it systematically leads us astray.</p>
<p>The solution is <strong>mental time travel</strong> — deliberately projecting yourself into the future to think from a perspective that isn’t available in the present moment.</p>
<h2>10-10-10 Thinking</h2>
<p>Suzy Welch’s <strong>10-10-10 framework</strong> is one of the simplest and most powerful tools for breaking the grip of present-moment emotion on decision-making. Before acting on an impulse or committing to a decision, ask three questions:</p>
<h3 class="tool-box">The 10-10-10 Questions</h3>
<p><strong>How will I feel about this decision in 10 minutes?</strong>
This question captures the immediate emotional reaction — the relief, the excitement, the fear. It’s not a guide to the decision, but it helps you name what you’re currently feeling.</p>
<p><strong>How will I feel about this decision in 10 months?</strong>
This is the medium-term lens. Most of the acute emotional charge of the present moment will have dissipated. You can see more clearly whether the decision was actually good.</p>
<p><strong>How will I feel about this decision in 10 years?</strong>
This is the long-term lens. From this distance, many things that feel catastrophic in the moment look minor, and many shortcuts that feel reasonable in the moment reveal their costs.</p>
<p>The power of 10-10-10 is that it doesn’t ignore your present emotions — it <em>contextualizes</em> them. You still have all the information from the 10-minute question; you just don’t let it dominate the other two.</p>
<h2>Backcasting: Working Backward from Success</h2>
<p><strong>Backcasting</strong> is the practice of imagining a future state of success and then working backward to understand what steps led to it.</p>
<p>Most planning works forward: here’s where we are, here’s what we’ll do, here’s where we’ll end up. Backcasting works backward: here’s where we want to end up — what would have to be true for us to get there?</p>
<h3 class="tool-box">How to Backcast</h3>
<ol>
<li>Define the future success state in concrete, specific terms: not “the project succeeds” but “we have 10,000 customers, unit economics are positive, and the team is energized.”</li>
<li>Imagine it’s X months or years from now and this success has been achieved.</li>
<li>Working backward, identify the key decision points and conditions that made it possible.</li>
<li>Use those identified conditions to guide your current planning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Backcasting is particularly valuable for revealing the dependencies and conditions that forward planning often misses. When you imagine a specific success and ask “what had to be true,” you often identify assumptions that aren’t being tested and risks that aren’t being managed.</p>
<h2>Premortem: Working Backward from Failure</h2>
<p>The <strong>premortem</strong> is the dark mirror of backcasting. Instead of imagining success, you imagine failure — and then work backward to understand why.</p>
<p>Before committing to a decision, conduct the following exercise with yourself or your decision pod:</p>
<h3 class="outcome-box">The Premortem Process</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Commit to the decision mentally</strong> (or as a group) — you’re going to do X.</li>
<li><strong>Project forward to failure:</strong> “It is one year from now. We did X, and it failed badly. What went wrong?”</li>
<li><strong>Generate all the causes of failure</strong> you can think of, without censoring or filtering for likelihood.</li>
<li><strong>Rank them by probability and impact.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ask:</strong> which of these failure modes can we prevent, mitigate, or plan around?</li>
</ol>
<p>The premortem works because the premise of failure removes social pressure to be optimistic. When you ask “are there any problems?” in a group, people who have doubts often stay quiet. When you say “it already failed — what happened?” everyone’s analytical mind activates. You surface risks that never would have emerged otherwise.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">Premortem vs. Post-Mortem</h3>
<p>A post-mortem happens after a failure. It’s valuable, but it’s too late to prevent the outcome you’re analyzing. A premortem happens before — it gives you the chance to prevent failure, not just understand it afterward. Used together, they create a powerful learning loop: premortem to catch foreseeable problems, post-mortem to learn from the ones you didn’t catch.</p>
<h2>Ulysses Contracts: Binding Your Future Self</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful applications of mental time travel is the <strong>Ulysses contract</strong> — a precommitment strategy in which you, from a calm and clear-headed state, constrain the options available to your future self in a more emotionally charged state.</p>
<p>The name comes from the Odyssey: Ulysses knew that the Sirens’ song would make him want to steer toward the rocks, so he had himself tied to the mast and ordered his crew to ignore his commands until they were safely past. He used his present calm judgment to precommit against his predictable future irrationality.</p>
<h3 class="bet-box">Ulysses Contracts in Practice</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investors</strong> who set automatic stop-loss orders are making Ulysses contracts: they know that during a market panic, they’ll want to hold on — so they precommit to selling before the panic arrives.</li>
<li><strong>Dieters</strong> who don’t buy junk food at the grocery store are using the same logic: they know that at 11pm, their willpower will be lower than at 2pm when shopping.</li>
<li><strong>Executives</strong> who schedule important decisions for early in the day are precommitting against decision fatigue.</li>
<li><strong>Anyone</strong> who sets up automatic savings or debt payments is precommitting their future self to financial habits their present self has decided are important.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key insight is that you are not one person — you are a sequence of future selves, each with their own emotional state and impulses. Your calm, reflective present self can make commitments on behalf of your future, more emotionally reactive self. Done well, this is not self-restriction — it’s self-governance.</p>
<h2>Regret Minimization: Bezos’s Framework</h2>
<p>Jeff Bezos has described his own version of mental time travel, which he calls the <strong>regret minimization framework</strong>. Facing a difficult decision about leaving a stable job to start Amazon, he imagined himself at age 80 looking back on his life. Which choice would he regret more — taking the leap and failing, or never having tried?</p>
<p>Seen from age 80, the answer was obvious. This perspective, unavailable from the present moment, made the decision clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I’m 80, I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have. I knew that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet.”
— Jeff Bezos</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>Think about a decision you’re currently deferring or afraid to make. Imagine yourself 20 years from now, looking back. Which path would the older you regret more — the one you took, or the one you avoided? Does that shift anything about how you see the choice today?</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporal discounting</strong> — overweighting the present versus the future — systematically distorts our decisions; mental time travel is the corrective.</li>
<li>The <strong>10-10-10 framework</strong> contextualizes present emotions by asking how you’ll feel about a decision in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years.</li>
<li><strong>Backcasting</strong> — imagining success and working backward — reveals dependencies and assumptions that forward planning misses.</li>
<li>The <strong>premortem</strong> — imagining failure before committing — surfaces risks that social optimism suppresses; it’s the most underused tool in decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Ulysses contracts</strong> let your calm present self precommit against your predictably irrational future self.</li>
<li><strong>Regret minimization</strong> — imagining yourself at the end of your life looking back — cuts through present-day noise to reveal what actually matters.</li>
</ul>
