            <p>On Earth the little prince meets a fox who asks to be tamed. Through the fox he learns that &quot;taming&quot; means creating ties—and that it is the time we give to someone that makes them unique in all the world. He also learns that what is essential is invisible to the eye.</p>
<h2>Taming</h2>
<p>The fox explains that he is just a fox like a hundred thousand others—until the prince tames him. Then he will be unique to the prince, and the prince will be unique to him. Taming takes patience: the prince must come at the same time each day, sit a little closer each time, and say nothing at first. Ritual and time create the bond.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.&quot;
— The Fox, The Little Prince</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Responsibility</h2>
<p>When the prince is about to leave, the fox is sad—but he gives the prince a secret: &quot;You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.&quot; The prince realizes he is responsible for his rose. He thought she was like the thousands of roses in the garden—but because he has tamed her and she has tamed him, she is the one that matters.</p>
<h3>Key Insight {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>Love is not in appearance but in the bond. The time we give, the rituals we share, the responsibility we accept—that is what makes a person or a rose unique. The heart sees what the eye cannot.</p>
