            <p>The little prince's home is a tiny asteroid with three volcanoes (one extinct) and a single rose. He cleans the volcanoes, pulls baobab seedlings, and cares for the rose—but her vanity and demands confuse him, so he leaves to understand more.</p>
<h2>The Rose</h2>
<p>The rose is beautiful and unique to the prince, but she is also vain and difficult. She asks for a screen and a glass globe, and she coughs to get attention. The prince takes her words literally and feels hurt. He does not yet understand that her behavior is a way of loving—and that he is responsible for her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.&quot;
— The Fox, The Little Prince</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Tending the Planet</h2>
<p>The prince's daily tasks—pulling small baobabs before they take over, cleaning the volcanoes—teach discipline and care. His planet is small; one step can take him around it. But that smallness makes every detail meaningful.</p>
<h3>Key Insight {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>Responsibility is not a burden but a bond. The prince will learn from the fox that it is the time he gave to his rose that makes her unique in all the world.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Those we love can be difficult; love includes accepting and caring anyway.</li>
<li>We are responsible for what we have tamed—for the bonds we create.</li>
<li>Small worlds can hold great meaning when we tend them with care.</li>
</ul>
