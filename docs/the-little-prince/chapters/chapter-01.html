        <div class="intro">
            <p>The narrator—a pilot—recalls his childhood drawing of a boa constrictor that had swallowed an elephant. Adults saw only a hat and advised him to put aside drawing and focus on geography and arithmetic. So he gave up drawing and learned to speak like a grown-up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Grown-Ups and Seeing</h2>
            <p>Grown-ups need things explained. They ask "How much?" and "What does it weigh?" instead of "What does it look like?" or "What does it mean?" The pilot learned that talking to them about the boa and the stars was useless—they could not see with the heart.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them."

            <h4>Key Insight</h4>
            <p>The book begins with a warning: we can lose the ability to see what is essential when we adopt only the grown-up way of seeing—numbers, labels, explanations. The little prince will remind the pilot (and us) to see again.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Adults often miss what children see—imagination and meaning.</li>
                <li>Explaining everything can replace seeing and wondering.</li>
                <li>The story is an invitation to see with the heart again.</li>
            </ul>
