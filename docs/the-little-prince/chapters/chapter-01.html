        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>The narrator—a pilot—recalls his childhood drawing of a boa constrictor that had swallowed an elephant. Adults saw only a hat and advised him to put aside drawing and focus on geography and arithmetic. So he gave up drawing and learned to speak like a grown-up.</p>
<h2>Grown-Ups and Seeing</h2>
<p>Grown-ups need things explained. They ask &quot;How much?&quot; and &quot;What does it weigh?&quot; instead of &quot;What does it look like?&quot; or &quot;What does it mean?&quot; The pilot learned that talking to them about the boa and the stars was useless—they could not see with the heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.&quot;
— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Key Insight {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>The book begins with a warning: we can lose the ability to see what is essential when we adopt only the grown-up way of seeing—numbers, labels, explanations. The little prince will remind the pilot (and us) to see again.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adults often miss what children see—imagination and meaning.</li>
<li>Explaining everything can replace seeing and wondering.</li>
<li>The story is an invitation to see with the heart again.</li>
</ul>
