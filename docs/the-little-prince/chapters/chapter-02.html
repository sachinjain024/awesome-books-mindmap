            <p>Stranded in the Sahara after a plane crash, the pilot is woken by a small voice asking him to draw a sheep. So begins his friendship with the little prince—a child from another world who will change the way he sees everything.</p>
<h2>The Request for a Sheep</h2>
<p>The little prince does not explain where he comes from; he simply asks for a sheep. The pilot draws the boa from his childhood—and the prince sees it correctly: an elephant inside a boa. For the first time in years, someone sees what the pilot meant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Please... draw me a sheep.&quot;
— The Little Prince</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Drawing the Sheep</h2>
<p>The pilot draws several sheep; the prince finds something wrong with each. Finally the pilot draws a box and says the sheep is inside. The prince is delighted—he can imagine it. The lesson: what we create together with imagination is often better than literal accuracy.</p>
<h3>Key Insight {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>Seeing with the heart means participating in meaning—imagining the sheep in the box, seeing the elephant in the boa. The prince restores the pilot's capacity for wonder and connection.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Being seen—as the pilot is when the prince recognizes his drawing—heals and connects.</li>
<li>Imagination (the sheep in the box) can be more true than literal representation.</li>
<li>Simple requests can open a door to a deeper relationship.</li>
</ul>
