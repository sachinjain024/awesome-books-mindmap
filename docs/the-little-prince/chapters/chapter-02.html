        <div class="chapter-meta">The Little Prince</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Stranded in the Sahara after a plane crash, the pilot is woken by a small voice asking him to draw a sheep. So begins his friendship with the little prince—a child from another world who will change the way he sees everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Request for a Sheep</h2>
            <p>The little prince does not explain where he comes from; he simply asks for a sheep. The pilot draws the boa from his childhood—and the prince sees it correctly: an elephant inside a boa. For the first time in years, someone sees what the pilot meant.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Please... draw me a sheep."
                <div class="attribution">— The Little Prince</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Drawing the Sheep</h2>
            <p>The pilot draws several sheep; the prince finds something wrong with each. Finally the pilot draws a box and says the sheep is inside. The prince is delighted—he can imagine it. The lesson: what we create together with imagination is often better than literal accuracy.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Seeing with the heart means participating in meaning—imagining the sheep in the box, seeing the elephant in the boa. The prince restores the pilot's capacity for wonder and connection.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Being seen—as the pilot is when the prince recognizes his drawing—heals and connects.</li>
                <li>Imagination (the sheep in the box) can be more true than literal representation.</li>
                <li>Simple requests can open a door to a deeper relationship.</li>
            </ul>
