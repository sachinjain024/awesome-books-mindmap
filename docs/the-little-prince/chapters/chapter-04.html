            <p>The little prince visits six asteroids. On each he meets a grown-up: a king, a vain man, a drunkard, a businessman, a lamplighter, and a geographer. Each encounter shows how adults can become trapped in roles that have nothing to do with meaning or love.</p>
<h2>The King, the Vain Man, the Drunkard</h2>
<p>The king commands everything but has no one to command; the vain man wants only to be admired; the drunkard drinks to forget the shame of drinking. The prince finds them odd. They are alone on their asteroids, absorbed in themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Grown-ups are certainly very odd.&quot;
— The Little Prince</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Businessman and the Lamplighter</h2>
<p>The businessman counts stars he believes he owns—he is &quot;busy with matters of consequence.&quot; The lamplighter is the only one the prince admires: his work has meaning (lighting and extinguishing the lamp), and he is faithful to it even though his planet now turns every minute.</p>
<h3>Key Insight {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>Matters of &quot;consequence&quot; for grown-ups are often empty—owning, counting, ruling. The lamplighter matters because he serves something beyond himself. The prince is drawn to purpose and devotion.</p>
<h2>The Geographer</h2>
<p>The geographer records mountains and seas but never leaves his desk; he relies on explorers. He advises the prince to visit Earth. So the little prince comes to our planet—and there he will meet the fox and learn what &quot;taming&quot; means.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many adults are absorbed in roles that give no real meaning—power, admiration, possession.</li>
<li>Work that serves others (like the lamplighter's) can be worthy of respect.</li>
<li>The journey from asteroid to asteroid is a journey through different ways of (mis)living.</li>
</ul>
