            <h2>About This Book</h2>
<p>A pilot stranded in the desert meets a little prince who has traveled from a tiny asteroid. Through their conversations, Saint-Exupéry explores what truly matters: seeing with the heart, taming and being responsible for those we love, and the meaning we give to the people and things in our lives.</p>
<p>This mind map presents the essential journey of the little prince—from his planet and his rose, through his encounters with bewildering grown-ups, to his friendship with the fox who teaches him the secret of love. It's a story about what we gain by giving time and attention, and what we lose when we forget to see with the heart.</p>

                <li><strong>See with the heart:</strong> What is essential is invisible to the eye.</li>
                
                <li><strong>You are responsible for what you tame:</strong> Love creates obligation and meaning.</li>
                
                <li><strong>It is the time you gave that makes your rose unique:</strong> Relationships gain value through care.</li>
