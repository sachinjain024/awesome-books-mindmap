            <h2>About This Book</h2>
<p>Simon Sinek explores why some organizations inspire fierce loyalty while others struggle with turnover and distrust. Drawing on biology, anthropology, and real-world examples, Sinek reveals that great leaders create a “Circle of Safety” where people feel valued and protected.</p>
<p>When leaders prioritize the wellbeing of their people, trust forms naturally. Teams cooperate willingly, innovation flourishes, and people give their discretionary effort. But when leaders treat people as numbers or prioritize short-term gains over human needs, cortisol floods the system, trust erodes, and organizations fracture from within.</p>
<p>This mind map presents Sinek’s insights on trust, cooperation, and what makes teams thrive. From the neuroscience of leadership chemicals to practical examples of companies that got it right (and wrong), you’ll discover why the best leaders always eat last.</p>

            <h3>Core Stoic Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Circle of Safety:</strong> Great leaders create environments where people feel safe from internal politics and threats, allowing them to focus outward on challenges.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Trust is Biology:</strong> Our brains release oxytocin when we feel safe and trusted. This chemical drives cooperation and loyalty.</li>
                
                <li><strong>E.D.S.O. Chemicals:</strong> Endorphins (mask pain), Dopamine (gets things done), Serotonin (pride/status), Oxytocin (love/trust) drive behavior.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Cortisol is the Enemy:</strong> Stress and fear trigger cortisol, which inhibits oxytocin, destroys trust, and makes us selfish.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Abstraction Kills Empathy:</strong> When people become numbers, it&#39;s easy to harm them. Leaders must keep the human visible.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Leaders Sacrifice:</strong> True leaders eat last—they sacrifice their comfort for the good of those in their care.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Leadership is a Choice:</strong> It&#39;s not about rank or authority. Anyone can create safety for those around them.</li>
