            <p>Sinek addresses common objections to creating safety: “But what about performance?” “What about accountability?” “Won’t people get complacent?” The answers reveal why safety actually enables higher performance.</p>
<h2>Objection 1: What About Performance?</h2>
<p>The concern: If people feel too safe, won’t they become lazy?</p>
<h3 class="concept-box">The Reality</h3>
<p>Safety doesn’t mean no expectations. It means people can focus on meeting those expectations instead of worrying about office politics or job security. High-performing teams have both high standards AND high safety.</p>
<h2>Objection 2: What About Accountability?</h2>
<p>Safety doesn’t eliminate accountability—it makes it possible. When people feel safe, they:</p>
<h3 class="safety-box">Accountability in Safe Environments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Admit mistakes openly (instead of hiding them)</li>
<li>Ask for help when struggling</li>
<li>Hold each other accountable (peer pressure works)</li>
<li>Take responsibility for outcomes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Objection 3: Not Everyone Deserves Trust</h2>
<p>True—some people abuse trust. But this reveals a selection and culture problem, not a reason to abandon trust.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">Building Trust</h3>
<p>Start with trust, verify through behavior. When someone violates trust, address it directly. But don’t punish everyone for one person’s failure by removing trust from the whole organization.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Safety and high standards aren’t opposites—they enable each other</li>
<li>Accountability works better when people feel safe to admit mistakes</li>
<li>Trust isn’t naive—it’s the foundation for performance</li>
<li>Address trust violations individually, don’t punish everyone</li>
</ul>
