            <p>Humans are social animals. We're wired for belonging—it's not a nice-to-have, it's a survival need. When we feel we belong, we're willing to sacrifice for the group. When we don't, we protect ourselves first.</p>
<h2>We Are Social Animals</h2>
<p>For most of human history, being part of a tribe wasn't optional—it was survival. Alone, we were vulnerable to predators and the elements. Together, we thrived.</p>
<h3>The Biology of Belonging {.biology-box}</h3>
<p>Our brains evolved to reward belonging with good feelings and punish isolation with stress. This isn't cultural—it's biological. We need to belong like we need food and water.</p>
<h2>The Modern Tribe: Our Organizations</h2>
<p>Today, our companies and organizations serve the tribal role. When they function well, we feel safe and valued. When they don't, we experience the same stress our ancestors felt when exiled from the tribe.</p>
<h3>Signs of Belonging at Work {.concept-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Feeling your contributions matter</li>
<li>Being seen and acknowledged</li>
<li>Having colleagues who have your back</li>
<li>Leaders who protect you</li>
<li>Willingness to help others succeed</li>
</ul>
<h2>When We Don't Belong</h2>
<p>The stress of not belonging isn't just emotional—it's physical. Our bodies respond to social exclusion the same way they respond to physical danger.</p>
<h3>Effects of Not Belonging {.warning-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chronic stress and cortisol elevation</li>
<li>Reduced immune function</li>
<li>Anxiety and depression</li>
<li>Decreased performance</li>
<li>Withdrawal and disengagement</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Belonging is a biological need, not just an emotional preference</li>
<li>Organizations serve the tribal role in modern life</li>
<li>When we belong, we cooperate; when we don't, we protect ourselves</li>
<li>Social exclusion creates physical stress responses</li>
</ul>
