    <h2>A Childhood of Loss</h2>
    <p>To understand Morrie's teachings, you must understand his life. Morrie Schwartz was born in 1916 and grew up in the Bronx, New York, in poverty. His family was Russian-Jewish immigrants struggling to make ends meet in America.</p>
    <p>When Morrie was eight years old, his mother died. The loss was devastating. Young Morrie was given the task of reading the telegram from the sanatorium that announced her death — because his father, Charlie, could barely read English. A child had to deliver the news of his own mother's passing to his family.</p>
</div>
<div class="backstory">
    <h3>The Telegram</h3>
    <p>Imagine being eight years old and reading the words that tell you your mother is gone. This moment shaped Morrie profoundly. He would later say that the loss of his mother taught him how precious love is — and how quickly it can be taken away. It was the beginning of his lifelong insistence that love must be expressed openly, immediately, and without reservation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Charlie and Eva</h2>
    <p>Morrie's father, Charlie, was a quiet, cold man — not cruel, but emotionally absent. He worked in the fur industry and came home exhausted, offering little warmth or affection. Charlie told Morrie and his brother David never to speak of their mother's death to anyone, sealing the grief inside them.</p>
    <p>Then Eva arrived. When Morrie was about nine, Charlie married Eva, a Romanian immigrant. Eva transformed the household. She was warm, loving, and fiercely devoted to education. She read to the boys, encouraged their curiosity, and gave Morrie the maternal love he had been starving for.</p>
</div>
<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>Eva showed Morrie that love could be rebuilt after loss. She proved that one caring person could change everything. Morrie would carry this lesson into every classroom, every relationship, every Tuesday conversation: love is not scarce. It can always be given, always be received, always be renewed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>David's Polio</h2>
    <p>Morrie's younger brother David contracted polio as a child. While Morrie ran and played in the streets, David wore leg braces and struggled to walk. Morrie carried tremendous guilt about this — why was he healthy while his brother suffered? This guilt planted a seed of empathy that would define his character. He learned early that suffering is not fair, that life deals uneven hands, and that compassion for others is not optional.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Choosing to Teach</h2>
    <p>After graduating from college, Morrie's first job was at a psychiatric hospital. The experience was formative. He watched patients who had been abandoned by the world — people who lay on cold floors while staff walked around them as if they were furniture.</p>
    <p>One day, Morrie lay down on the floor beside one of these patients. He discovered something simple but profound: she just wanted to be noticed. She wanted someone to acknowledge that she existed, that she mattered.</p>
</div>
<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>Everyone Wants to Be Seen</h3>
    <p>Morrie's experience at the mental hospital crystallized his life's purpose. People do not need to be fixed — they need to be acknowledged. The simple act of being present with someone, of truly seeing them, is one of the most powerful things a human being can do. This insight drove Morrie away from his father's fur factory and toward a life of teaching.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Beloved Professor</h2>
    <p>Morrie joined the sociology department at Brandeis University and became one of its most beloved professors. His classes were unconventional — he brought students into conversations rather than lecturing at them. He danced, he cried, he hugged. He challenged students to question the assumptions they had absorbed from society about success, money, and status.</p>
    <p>He was, as he would later choose for his epitaph, "A Teacher to the Last."</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>In 1994, Morrie noticed he could no longer dance. Dancing had been his weekly joy — he went to a church every Wednesday evening and danced freely to all kinds of music. When his legs began to betray him, he knew something was wrong.</p>
    <p>The diagnosis was ALS — amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It is a progressive, terminal illness that destroys the nerves controlling voluntary muscle movement. The body slowly shuts down while the mind remains sharp. There is no cure.</p>
    <p>Morrie's response was characteristically defiant. Rather than withdrawing, he decided to study his own death. He would make dying his final project, his closing lecture, his ultimate subject. He invited people to visit. He held informal discussion groups. And when Ted Koppel came calling, he said yes.</p>

    <p>Who was the person who most shaped your understanding of love? What did they teach you — not through words, but through how they lived?</p>
