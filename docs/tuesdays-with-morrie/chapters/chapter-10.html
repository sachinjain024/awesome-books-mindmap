    <h3>The Eighth Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: Money — Why materialism fails and what to pursue instead</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Great Deception</h2>
    <p>Morrie has never been wealthy. He lived a professor's life — modest income, modest house, modest possessions. By the standards of the culture Mitch inhabits — sports, media, entertainment — Morrie is practically poor.</p>
    <p>And yet, as Mitch sits with this dying professor surrounded by love, conversation, and meaning, a question begins to form: who is actually richer?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Brainwashing</h2>
    <p>Morrie uses a strong word: brainwashing. He believes that society brainwashes people into believing that their self-worth is determined by their possessions. From childhood, through advertising, social comparison, and cultural narratives, people absorb the message that more money means more value, more status, more worth as a human being.</p>
    <p>This brainwashing is so effective that most people never question it. They spend their entire lives accumulating — bigger houses, newer cars, more clothes — without ever asking whether any of it makes them happy. The answer, Morrie suggests, is almost always no. The accumulation creates a hunger that feeds on itself. The more you have, the more you want. The more you want, the more you work. The more you work, the less you live.</p>
</div>
<div class="aphorism">
    We've got a form of brainwashing going on in our country. More is good. More is good. We repeat it — and have it repeated to us — over and over until nobody bothers to even think otherwise.
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>What Money Cannot Buy</h2>
    <p>Morrie is not naive about money. He understands that you need enough to meet your basic needs — food, shelter, health care. He is not advocating poverty. But he is drawing a sharp line between enough and more.</p>
    <p>Beyond the baseline of security, money buys comfort but not happiness. It buys entertainment but not meaning. It buys attention but not love. The things that actually sustain a human being — deep relationships, purposeful work, a sense of belonging — cannot be purchased.</p>
</div>
<div class="contrast">
    <div class="society-says">
        <h4>More Is Better</h4>
        <p>Earn more, buy more, have more. Your possessions reflect your worth. Success is measured in dollars.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="morrie-teaches">
        <h4>Enough Is Enough</h4>
        <p>Once your basic needs are met, additional money adds little. Invest in people and purpose, not possessions.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Mitch Contrast</h2>
    <p>The contrast between Morrie and Mitch is stark on this topic. Mitch earns a good salary. He has a house, a car, a successful career. He fills his time with work because work produces money and money produces security and security — he believes — produces happiness.</p>
    <p>But Mitch is not happy. He is comfortable, productive, and busy, but not happy. He works through weekends. He checks his phone compulsively. He has sacrificed relationships on the altar of career advancement. The money has given him everything except the one thing he actually needs: a sense that his life has meaning beyond his bank balance.</p>
</div>
<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>The Real Currency</h3>
    <p>Morrie offers an alternative metric for wealth: how much love do you give? How much do you receive? How connected are you to the people around you? How much of your time is spent on activities that you find genuinely meaningful? These are the true measures of a rich life — and they have nothing to do with money.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Devote Yourself</h2>
    <p>Morrie distills his teaching on money into a single, memorable instruction:</p>
</div>
<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>Devote yourself to loving others. Devote yourself to your community around you. And devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning. These three devotions — love, community, and purpose — are the true sources of fulfillment. Everything else is decoration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Ted Turner and the Emptiness of Wealth</h2>
    <p>During this conversation, Morrie mentions Ted Turner — the billionaire media mogul who once said that his wealth had not made him happy. Morrie uses this as evidence, not with scorn but with sadness. Here is a man who has everything money can buy and still feels empty. If a billion dollars cannot buy happiness, then the pursuit of money as a path to fulfillment is a dead end.</p>
    <p>The lesson is not that wealthy people are bad. It is that wealth as a goal is insufficient. Money is a tool, not a destination. When you make it the destination, you arrive and find that nothing is there.</p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Society Brainwashes Us:</strong> The equation "more money = more worth" is a cultural lie, not a truth</li>
        <li><strong>Enough vs. More:</strong> Money matters for basic needs, but beyond that, it adds diminishing returns to happiness</li>
        <li><strong>The Three Devotions:</strong> Invest in love, community, and purpose — not in accumulation</li>
        <li><strong>Wealth Cannot Buy Meaning:</strong> The richest people often feel the emptiest, proving that money is not the answer</li>
        <li><strong>Redefine Rich:</strong> True wealth is measured in relationships, purpose, and the love you give and receive</li>
    </ul>

<div class="reflection">
    <p>If you had all the money you could ever need, what would you do with your time? Now ask yourself: why aren't you doing more of that already?</p>
