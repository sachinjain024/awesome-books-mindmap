    <h3>The First Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: The World — How dying opened Morrie's heart to the suffering around him</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Weight of the World</h2>
    <p>When Mitch arrives for their first formal Tuesday session, he finds Morrie watching the morning news. Morrie is crying. On the television, people are suffering — war, famine, displacement. Most of us watch the same news and feel numb, overwhelmed, or indifferent. But Morrie weeps openly.</p>
    <p>This is not the reaction of a man who has retreated into his own suffering. It is the opposite. As Morrie's body fails, his emotional capacity expands. His own mortality has cracked him open, making him more sensitive to the pain of others, not less.</p>
</div>
<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>Morrie does not see his tears as weakness. He sees them as proof that he is still alive, still connected, still human. In a culture that rewards emotional suppression — particularly in men — Morrie's willingness to cry is an act of rebellion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Compassion Through Vulnerability</h2>
    <p>Morrie explains that his illness has given him an unexpected gift: the ability to feel more deeply. When you know you are dying, the walls come down. You stop pretending that other people's suffering does not affect you. You stop performing strength and start practicing openness.</p>
    <p>He tells Mitch that he feels connected to people all over the world — people he has never met, people whose suffering he sees on a screen. Their pain is his pain. Their joy could be his joy, if only they knew how to find it.</p>
</div>
<div class="contrast">
    <div class="society-says">
        <h4>Be Strong</h4>
        <p>"Don't cry. Toughen up. Keep your emotions in check. Showing vulnerability is weakness."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="morrie-teaches">
        <h4>Be Open</h4>
        <p>"Crying is not weakness. It is the body's way of acknowledging truth. Let yourself feel — that is how you stay alive."</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Mitch's Discomfort</h2>
    <p>Mitch is uncomfortable with Morrie's tears. He comes from a world of deadlines, scores, and professional detachment. Sports journalism does not reward emotional openness. Mitch watches Morrie cry and feels awkward — he does not know what to do with this level of vulnerability.</p>
    <p>This discomfort is the beginning of Mitch's transformation. Over the coming weeks, he will slowly learn that Morrie's emotional openness is not a symptom of his illness — it is the cure for Mitch's own emotional numbness.</p>
</div>
<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>Mortality Opens the Heart</h3>
    <p>Most of us live as if we are immortal, and this illusion allows us to keep the world at arm's length. We scroll past suffering, we change the channel, we look away. Morrie cannot look away anymore — and this is his liberation. When you accept that your time is limited, everything becomes more vivid, more urgent, more worthy of your tears and your attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Hibiscus Plant</h2>
    <p>By Morrie's window sits a small hibiscus plant. Its pink leaves fall one by one. Morrie watches it with tenderness rather than sadness. The plant does not resist its seasons. It does not rage against the dropping of its leaves. It simply lives its cycle — bloom, shed, rest, bloom again.</p>
    <p>Morrie sees himself in this plant. He too is shedding — his muscles, his mobility, his independence. But he is determined to bloom until the very end, to keep opening his heart even as his body closes down.</p>
</div>
<div class="metaphor-box">
    <h3>The Hibiscus</h3>
    <p>The hibiscus plant by Morrie's window is a recurring symbol throughout the book. Its falling pink leaves mirror Morrie's physical decline, but they also represent the natural cycle of life. The plant does not grieve its lost petals — it continues to live according to its nature. Morrie aspires to the same acceptance: to shed what must be shed without losing his essential self.</p>
</div>
<div class="key-points">
    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vulnerability Is Strength:</strong> Morrie's willingness to cry openly is not weakness — it is proof of his deep connection to life</li>
        <li><strong>Mortality Expands Compassion:</strong> Confronting death can make us more empathetic, not less — if we let it</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional Numbness Is a Choice:</strong> We train ourselves not to feel; Morrie chooses to untrain himself</li>
        <li><strong>Connection Requires Openness:</strong> You cannot truly connect with others while keeping your guard up</li>
        <li><strong>Nature Accepts Its Seasons:</strong> Like the hibiscus, we can learn to accept life's cycles without resistance</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="reflection">
    <p>When was the last time you let yourself cry — not out of frustration, but out of genuine feeling for someone else's experience? What would happen if you let that wall down more often?</p>
