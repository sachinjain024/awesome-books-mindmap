    <h3>The Tenth Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: Marriage — What makes a partnership last through forty-four years and beyond</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>A Special Guest</h2>
    <p>This Tuesday is different. Mitch brings his wife, Janine, to meet Morrie. Janine is a professional singer, and when Morrie learns this, he asks her to sing for him. She hesitates — it feels strange to perform for a dying man in his study — but Morrie insists.</p>
    <p>When Janine sings, Morrie closes his eyes and weeps. The tears are not of sadness. They are the tears of a man who is still moved by beauty, still capable of being overwhelmed by something as simple and profound as a human voice making music. This moment captures everything Morrie teaches: stay open, feel fully, let beauty penetrate you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Forty-Four Years with Charlotte</h2>
    <p>Morrie and his wife Charlotte have been married for forty-four years. Charlotte, who teaches at MIT, is Morrie's anchor during his illness. She manages his care, coordinates his visitors, and maintains the household while watching the man she loves slowly disappear.</p>
    <p>Morrie speaks of Charlotte with deep tenderness and respect. Their marriage is not a fairy tale — it is a partnership that has survived decades of ordinary challenges. But it has endured because it is built on foundations that do not erode.</p>
</div>
<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>Marriage, Morrie teaches, is not about finding the perfect person. It is about finding someone whose imperfections you can live with — and whose values align with yours on the things that matter most. The foundation is not passion, though passion matters. The foundation is respect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Rules of Marriage</h2>
    <p>Morrie distills his understanding of marriage into a set of principles — not romantic ideals, but practical requirements for a partnership that lasts:</p>
</div>
<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>What Marriage Requires</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mutual Respect:</strong> You must genuinely respect each other — not just love, but respect. Love without respect becomes possession. Respect without love becomes formality. You need both.</li>
        <li><strong>The Ability to Compromise:</strong> Two people cannot share a life without regularly yielding to each other. Compromise is not surrender — it is the acknowledgment that your partner's needs are as valid as your own.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Communication:</strong> Talk honestly about everything — feelings, fears, desires, resentments. The things left unsaid are the things that destroy marriages. Silence is not peace; it is a slow poison.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Values:</strong> You do not need to agree on everything, but you must agree on the importance of the marriage itself. Both partners must believe that the relationship is worth fighting for, even when fighting is hard.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Common Belief Problem</h2>
    <p>Morrie emphasizes one requirement above all others: both partners must share a common set of values. Not identical opinions — Morrie and Charlotte disagreed on plenty — but a shared understanding of what matters. If one person values career above everything and the other values family, the marriage will fracture along that fault line.</p>
    <p>The most important shared belief, Morrie says, is the belief in the marriage itself. Both people must be committed to making it work. When both partners treat the relationship as sacred — not in a religious sense, but in the sense of "this matters more than winning any argument" — the marriage can weather almost anything.</p>

    <h4>On Finding the Right Person</h4>
    <div class="dialogue-line mitch">
        <span class="speaker">Mitch:</span> How do you know if you've found the right person to marry?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-line morrie">
        <span class="speaker">Morrie:</span> There are a few rules I know to be true about love and marriage. If you don't respect the other person, you're gonna have a lot of trouble. If you don't know how to compromise, you're gonna have a lot of trouble. If you can't talk openly about what goes on between you, you're gonna have a lot of trouble. And if you don't have a common set of values in life, you're gonna have a lot of trouble.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Love as Action</h2>
    <p>Morrie does not talk about love as a feeling alone. He talks about it as a practice — something you do every day, not something you have once and then coast on. Love is an active verb: listening, compromising, showing up, forgiving, choosing your partner again and again even when the initial excitement has faded.</p>
    <p>Charlotte demonstrates this practice every day as she cares for Morrie. She does not do it because it is easy or pleasant. She does it because their forty-four years of mutual investment have built something that transcends comfort. Their marriage is a structure built of daily acts of love, and it is strong enough to hold the weight of dying.</p>
</div>
<div class="contrast">
    <div class="society-says">
        <h4>Follow Your Heart</h4>
        <p>Love should be effortless. If it's hard, it's wrong. Find someone who makes you happy all the time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="morrie-teaches">
        <h4>Build Your Love</h4>
        <p>Marriage takes work — daily, deliberate effort. Love is a practice, not just a feeling. Choose your partner again every day.</p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Respect Is the Foundation:</strong> Love without respect becomes possession; both are essential</li>
        <li><strong>Compromise Is Not Surrender:</strong> Yielding to your partner's needs is an act of strength, not weakness</li>
        <li><strong>Silence Destroys:</strong> Talk openly about everything — the unsaid things are the ones that erode a marriage</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Values Matter Most:</strong> You need a common belief in the importance of the marriage itself</li>
        <li><strong>Love Is a Daily Practice:</strong> Choose your partner every day through listening, forgiving, and showing up</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="reflection">
    <p>In your closest relationship, are you practicing love as a daily verb — or are you coasting on the assumption that the feeling is enough?</p>
