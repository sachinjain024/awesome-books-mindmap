    <h3>The Twelfth Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: Forgiveness — Why you must make peace with yourself and others while there is still time</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Urgency of Forgiveness</h2>
    <p>Morrie's teaching on forgiveness carries a weight that his other lessons do not. This is not abstract philosophy. This is a man running out of time, urging those who still have it not to waste it on grudges.</p>
    <p>Morrie has a simple, powerful formula: forgive yourself before you die. Then forgive others. The order matters. You cannot truly forgive others until you have made peace with your own failures, your own mistakes, your own regrets.</p>
</div>
<div class="aphorism">
    Forgive yourself before you die. Then forgive others.
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Morrie's Deepest Regret</h2>
    <p>Morrie shares a story that haunts him — the story of his friend Norman. Norman was a fellow professor, a close friend who had made a bronze sculpture of Morrie as a gift. The two men were deeply connected.</p>
    <p>Then Charlotte, Morrie's wife, had surgery. Norman did not come. He did not call. He did not send a card. Morrie was hurt — deeply, bitterly hurt. He felt betrayed by someone he loved. And he held onto that hurt. He nursed it. He let it grow into a wall between them.</p>
    <p>Then Norman got cancer. And died. Before Morrie could forgive him. Before they could reconcile. Before Morrie could say, "I understand that people fail each other sometimes, and I love you anyway."</p>
</div>
<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>This is the regret that gnaws at Morrie most. Not a professional failure. Not a missed opportunity. Not a financial mistake. The thing that keeps him up at night is a friendship he let die because he could not bring himself to forgive. Norman's death made reconciliation impossible — and Morrie carries that impossibility like a stone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Why We Hold Grudges</h2>
    <p>Morrie understands why people hold grudges. When someone hurts you, the pain is real. Forgiveness can feel like letting the other person off the hook — as if you are saying that what they did was acceptable, that your pain does not matter.</p>
    <p>But Morrie reframes forgiveness entirely. It is not about the other person. It is about you. A grudge is a poison you drink hoping the other person will die. It consumes your energy, occupies your thoughts, and prevents you from being fully present in your life. The person you refuse to forgive may not even know you are angry. But you know. And it eats at you.</p>
</div>
<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>Forgiveness Is Freedom</h3>
    <p>Forgiveness does not mean forgetting. It does not mean condoning. It does not mean inviting the person back into your life as if nothing happened. It means releasing the hold that the injury has on you. It means choosing to stop carrying the weight of anger and resentment so that your hands are free to hold something better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Forgiving Yourself</h2>
    <p>Morrie insists that self-forgiveness must come first. Most people carry a catalog of regrets — things they said, things they failed to say, choices they made, paths they did not take. This catalog grows heavier with time, and for a dying person, the weight can become crushing.</p>
    <p>Morrie has his own catalog. He was not always the perfect father. He did not always make time for the people who needed him. He made mistakes in his relationships. He failed to forgive Norman.</p>
    <p>But Morrie has forgiven himself for these things. Not because they do not matter, but because holding himself hostage to past mistakes serves no one. Self-punishment does not undo the harm. It only adds more suffering to the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>"You Would Have Been a Good Son"</h2>
    <p>In a moment of extraordinary tenderness, Morrie tells Mitch that he would have liked him as a son. It is a statement that surprises Mitch — and moves him deeply. Morrie is not just a professor to Mitch. He has become a father figure, filling a role that Mitch's actual father — a quiet, emotionally reserved man — never quite managed.</p>
    <p>This exchange is itself an act of forgiveness. Mitch is forgiving himself for the sixteen years he stayed away. Morrie is forgiving Mitch for the same thing. Neither of them uses the word "forgive." They do not need to. The love between them has already done the work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Hill by the Pond</h2>
    <p>After their conversation about forgiveness, Morrie takes Mitch — metaphorically, through description — to his chosen burial spot. It is a hill beneath a tree, overlooking a pond. Morrie has already picked it out. He describes it with the same warmth he would use to describe a vacation destination.</p>
    <p>This is not morbid. It is an act of acceptance — and of forgiveness toward life itself. Morrie has forgiven life for being finite. He has forgiven his body for failing. He has forgiven death for coming. And in doing so, he has freed himself to enjoy what remains.</p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Forgive Yourself First:</strong> You cannot fully forgive others until you have made peace with your own failures</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Wait:</strong> Norman's death taught Morrie that reconciliation has an expiration date — do not assume you have time</li>
        <li><strong>Grudges Hurt the Holder:</strong> The person you refuse to forgive may not even notice; you are the one suffering</li>
        <li><strong>Forgiveness Is Not Forgetting:</strong> It is releasing the hold that anger has on you, not pretending the hurt did not happen</li>
        <li><strong>Love Is the Vehicle:</strong> True forgiveness happens not through words but through the practice of love</li>
    </ul>

<div class="reflection">
    <p>Is there someone you need to forgive — including yourself? What would it cost you to let go of that grudge? What is it costing you to keep it?</p>
