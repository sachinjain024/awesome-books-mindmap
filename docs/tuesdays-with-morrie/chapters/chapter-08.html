    <h3>The Sixth Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: Emotions — How to experience feelings fully without being consumed by them</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>A Visible Decline</h2>
    <p>When Mitch arrives this Tuesday, Morrie's deterioration is unmistakable. He can no longer eat solid food. His body is weaker, his breathing more labored. The disease is accelerating its march through his muscles, claiming territory that will never be recovered.</p>
    <p>And yet this is the Tuesday where Morrie delivers one of his most profound teachings — on emotions, detachment, and the art of feeling without drowning.</p>
</div>
<div class="aphorism">
    Detachment doesn't mean you don't let the experience penetrate you. On the contrary, you let it penetrate you fully. That's how you are able to leave it.
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Misunderstanding of Detachment</h2>
    <p>Morrie draws on Buddhist philosophy, but he transforms the concept of detachment into something accessible and practical. Many people misunderstand detachment as emotional suppression — building walls, refusing to feel, maintaining a stoic distance from experience. This is not what Morrie means at all.</p>
    <p>True detachment, Morrie explains, is the opposite of suppression. It is full immersion followed by release. You do not avoid the emotion. You dive into it completely. You let fear be fear. You let sadness be sadness. You let grief be grief. You experience it with your whole being.</p>
    <p>And then — and this is the crucial part — you let it go.</p>
</div>
<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>The Wave</h3>
    <p>Think of an emotion like a wave. If you stand rigidly against it, it will knock you over. If you run from it, it will chase you. But if you let it wash over you — if you surrender to it completely — it will pass through you and recede. The wave is powerful, but it is temporary. Every emotion, no matter how intense, has a beginning, a middle, and an end.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Morrie's Practice</h2>
    <p>Morrie demonstrates this teaching in real time. When he feels afraid — afraid of suffocating, afraid of never being able to move his hands again, afraid of dying — he does not push the fear away. He sits with it. He says to himself: "This is fear. I am feeling fear. I acknowledge this fear."</p>
    <p>He lets the fear fill him up. He feels it in his chest, in his throat, in his belly. He gives it his full attention. And then, once he has fully experienced it, he steps back from it. He recognizes it as a feeling, not as his identity. He is not fear. He is a person experiencing fear. And the experience, like all experiences, passes.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue-box">
    <h4>On Feeling</h4>
    <div class="dialogue-line morrie">
        <span class="speaker">Morrie:</span> I know what I'm feeling. I can step right into it. I let myself experience it fully. But I don't wallow in it. I don't say, "this is terrible, I'm going to be miserable forever." I say, "this is what I'm feeling right now. Let me be present with it."
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-line morrie">
        <span class="speaker">Morrie:</span> And then I can say, "All right. I've recognized this emotion. Now I can move on."
    </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Why We Avoid Emotions</h2>
    <p>Morrie understands why most people avoid difficult emotions. Fear is uncomfortable. Grief is painful. Loneliness feels like a void. The natural human response is to avoid these feelings — through distraction, denial, substance use, overwork, or simply by keeping so busy that the feelings never have a chance to surface.</p>
    <p>But avoidance has a cost. When you refuse to feel sadness, you also diminish your capacity for joy. When you suppress fear, you lose access to courage — because courage requires acknowledging fear first. Emotional avoidance is not selective. You cannot numb one feeling without numbing them all.</p>

    <div class="society-says">
        <h4>Control Your Emotions</h4>
        <p>Keep a lid on it. Don't let feelings influence your decisions. Rationality is superior to emotion. Stay in control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="morrie-teaches">
        <h4>Experience Your Emotions</h4>
        <p>Dive into the feeling completely. Let it penetrate you fully. Then step back and let it go. Full experience is the path to freedom.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Emotional Climax</h2>
    <p>This chapter represents the emotional peak of the book. Morrie is at his most vulnerable — his body is failing him in ways that are deeply frightening — and yet he is at his most wise. He is living his own teaching in real time, experiencing the terror and sadness of his disease fully, then releasing it and returning to the present moment.</p>
    <p>For Mitch, watching Morrie navigate these enormous emotions with such grace is transformative. It challenges everything Mitch has learned about what it means to be strong. Strength, Morrie shows him, is not the absence of feeling. It is the willingness to feel everything and still remain open.</p>
</div>
<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>Most people are afraid of their own emotions because they confuse feeling with drowning. But Morrie proves that you can feel everything — grief, fear, love, joy, loneliness — without being destroyed by it. The emotion is not you. It is something moving through you. Let it move.</p>

<div class="reflection">
    <p>What emotion have you been avoiding or suppressing? What would happen if you gave yourself permission to feel it fully — not to drown in it, but to let it wash through you and pass?</p>
