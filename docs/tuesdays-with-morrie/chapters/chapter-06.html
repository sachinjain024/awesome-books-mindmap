    <h3>The Fourth Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: Death — Morrie's most famous teaching, and the foundation for every lesson that follows</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Central Teaching</h2>
    <p>This Tuesday contains Morrie's most famous and most important lesson. It is the foundation upon which every other teaching rests. Without understanding death, Morrie argues, you cannot understand life.</p>
    <p>Morrie is now dependent on an oxygen machine. His breathing is labored. His body is visibly deteriorating. And yet he speaks about death with a clarity and calmness that unsettles Mitch.</p>
</div>
<div class="aphorism">
    Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>The Problem with Denial</h2>
    <p>Most people, Morrie observes, live in a state of denial about death. They know intellectually that they will die, but they do not truly believe it. They live as if they have unlimited time — and this illusion shapes everything they do.</p>
    <p>Because they believe they have forever, they postpone. They postpone telling people they love them. They postpone pursuing work that matters. They postpone mending broken relationships. They postpone living.</p>
    <p>Morrie's diagnosis stripped away this illusion. And what he found underneath was not despair — it was urgency. When you truly accept that your time is finite, everything becomes more vivid, more precious, more worthy of your full attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>The Bird on Your Shoulder</h3>
    <p>Morrie borrows an image from Buddhist tradition: imagine that a little bird sits on your shoulder, and every day it asks, "Is today the day? Am I ready? Am I doing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be?" If you live with this awareness — the awareness that any day could be your last — you will never waste a moment on things that do not matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Morrie's Challenge to Mitch</h2>
    <p>Morrie turns the teaching into a direct challenge. He looks at Mitch and asks: if you accepted that you could die at any time, would you still do what you're doing right now? Would you still work the hours you work? Would you still fill your days the way you fill them?</p>
    <p>Mitch has no good answer. His life is built on the assumption of unlimited time. His work, his habits, his avoidance of difficult emotions — all of it depends on the fiction that he can deal with these things later.</p>
</div>
<div class="dialogue-box">
    <h4>The Challenge</h4>
    <div class="dialogue-line morrie">
        <span class="speaker">Morrie:</span> Everyone knows they're going to die, but nobody believes it. If we did, we would do things differently.
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-line mitch">
        <span class="speaker">Mitch:</span> So we kid ourselves about death?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-line morrie">
        <span class="speaker">Morrie:</span> Yes. But there's a better approach. To know you're going to die, and to be prepared for it at any time. That's better. That way you can actually be more involved in your life while you're living.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Lou Gehrig's Shadow</h2>
    <p>The disease that is killing Morrie is named after Lou Gehrig, the legendary baseball player who was diagnosed with ALS in 1939. Mitch, as a sports journalist, knows Gehrig's famous farewell speech well: "Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth."</p>
    <p>Morrie reflects on these words. How could a dying man call himself lucky? Because Gehrig understood what Morrie now understands: gratitude does not require perfect circumstances. You can be grateful for what you had, for the love you received, for the life you lived — even as that life is ending.</p>
</div>
<div class="contrast">
    <div class="society-says">
        <h4>Avoid Death</h4>
        <p>Don't think about it. Don't talk about it. Stay young, stay busy, stay distracted. Death is failure.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="morrie-teaches">
        <h4>Befriend Death</h4>
        <p>Keep death on your shoulder. Let it remind you what matters. Awareness of death is the key to being fully alive.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Death Strips Away the Unnecessary</h2>
    <p>Morrie explains that his illness, for all its cruelty, has given him a strange gift: absolute clarity about what matters. When you are dying, you do not care about your job title, your bank balance, or what car you drive. You care about the people you love and whether you told them. You care about whether you lived with integrity. You care about whether you were kind.</p>
    <p>This clarity is available to everyone — you do not need a terminal diagnosis to access it. You just need to stop pretending that you have forever.</p>
</div>
<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>The tragedy is not that we die. The tragedy is that most people never fully live. They are too busy being afraid of death to embrace life. Morrie's message is not morbid — it is the most life-affirming thing you can hear: stop wasting time. Love now. Be present now. Live now.</p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acceptance Enables Living:</strong> Learning to accept death frees you to live fully, without postponement or denial</li>
        <li><strong>The Bird on Your Shoulder:</strong> Carry the awareness of mortality with you — it clarifies everything</li>
        <li><strong>Denial Causes Waste:</strong> Pretending you have unlimited time is the single greatest source of wasted life</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity Through Finitude:</strong> A terminal diagnosis strips away everything unimportant — but you can access this clarity without one</li>
        <li><strong>Gratitude Amid Loss:</strong> Like Lou Gehrig, you can be grateful for what you had, even as it slips away</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="reflection">
    <p>If you truly believed that today could be your last day, what would you do differently? Who would you call? What would you say? What would you stop wasting time on?</p>
