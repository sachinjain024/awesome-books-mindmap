            <p>Nora realizes that the life she abandoned—the "root life"—is not worthless. It is the one where she can still make a difference: to her neighbor, to the people she teaches, to herself. It is the one where she has the chance to want what she has instead of what she didn't do. The root life is the only life that is still open—because it is the one she is actually in.</p>

<h2>Why the Root Life</h2>
<p>In every other life Nora was living a version that had already branched. The root life is the one where she still has agency—where she can choose to stay, to reach out, to try. It is also the one where the people who need her (her neighbor, her students, the town) are. Leaving the root life was not an answer; it was an escape. The answer is to want the life she has.</p></p>

“The root life is the one we have. It’s the one we can still change. It’s the one where we can choose to want what we have.”

<h4>Key Insight</h4>
<p>Wanting is a skill. We can learn to want the life we have—not by pretending it’s perfect, but by seeing that it is enough to work with and that we are needed in it.</p>
