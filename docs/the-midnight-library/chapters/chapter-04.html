            <p>Nora tries more lives: Olympic swimmer, glaciologist, pub owner. In each she finds something good and something missing. The library begins to destabilize—she cannot stay in the in-between forever. She must choose: find a life to stay in, or let the library end. She starts to wonder if the life she left—the "root life"—might be the one she was meant to want.</p>

<h2>Sampling Lives</h2>
<p>As an Olympic swimmer Nora has fame and discipline—but also pressure and injury. As a glaciologist she has purpose and wonder—but also loneliness. As a pub owner she has community—but also routine and limitation. Every life is a mix. There is no life where everything is solved.</p></p>

<h4>Key Insight</h4>
<p>The root life—the one Nora left—is not the worst life. It is the one where she has the most potential to be present, to help the people around her, and to want what she has. The library teaches her that wanting is a choice.</p>
