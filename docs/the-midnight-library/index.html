            <h2>About This Mind Map</h2>
<p>Nora Seed is full of regret. Between life and death she finds a library where every book is a different version of her life-the life if she had stayed in the band, married the man, become a glaciologist. As she tries life after life, she learns that no path is perfect-and that the only life worth living is the one we choose to live now.</p>

            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Regret:</strong> We carry the weight of what we did not do; the library helps Nora see that no alternate life is perfect.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Choice:</strong> The only life worth living is the one we choose to want.</li>
                
                <li><strong>The Present:</strong> The root life is the one we have, and it can be enough when we show up for it.</li>
                
                <li><strong>The Only Way to Learn:</strong> We cannot know a life by imagining it; we learn by living.</li>
