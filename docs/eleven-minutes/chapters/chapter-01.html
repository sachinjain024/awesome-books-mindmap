<h2>The Small Town</h2>
<p>Maria grows up in a small town in the interior of Brazil, where life moves to ancient rhythms and folklore shapes reality. Here, superstitions are woven into daily life, and traditional roles for women are clear and unquestioned: grow up, fall in love, marry, raise children, grow old together.</p>
<p>It's a world of certainties, where everyone knows their place and purpose. Maria, though good at school and always trying to better herself through reading books, has absorbed these certainties completely. Her dreams are simple, traditional, and shaped entirely by the culture around her.</p>
<h3>Maria's Single Dream {.journey-box}</h3>
<p>Maria has one overwhelming goal, one dream that defines her childhood and adolescence: to fall in love, marry, and raise a family.</p>
<p>Not career success. Not adventure. Not independence. Just love—romantic, transformative, eternal love. The kind she reads about in books, sees in movies, hears about in songs. Love that will make everything make sense, that will give her life purpose and meaning.</p>
<p>This singular focus isn't unusual in her world. It's what every girl is supposed to want. But in Maria's case, it becomes an obsession, a lens through which she sees everything else.</p>
<h2>The Weight of Expectations</h2>
<p>In Maria's small town, a woman's value is measured by her ability to attract and keep a good man. Intelligence, education, ambition—these matter less than beauty, virtue, and the capacity to be a good wife and mother.</p>
<p>Maria knows she's pretty. She knows boys look at her. This gives her confidence that her dream is achievable—that love will find her, that marriage will happen, that the life she imagines will unfold naturally.</p>
<p>But there's pressure too. The expectations of her family, her community, her culture. The unspoken understanding that a woman who doesn't marry, who doesn't fulfill this traditional role, has somehow failed at life.</p>
<h3>Books as Windows {.inner-light}</h3>
<p>Maria's saving grace is her love of reading. While other girls her age focus entirely on clothes and boys, Maria spends time in books, glimpsing worlds beyond her small town.</p>
<p>These books feed her romantic fantasies, yes—filling her head with stories of passionate love and devoted partners. But they also plant seeds of something else: curiosity about the wider world, hunger for experiences beyond what her town offers, the sense that life might contain more possibilities than the narrow path she's expected to follow.</p>
<p>She doesn't recognize this contradiction yet—between the traditional dream she consciously holds and the wider world she unconsciously craves. But it's there, dormant, waiting.</p>
<h2>The Romantic Fantasy</h2>
<p>Maria's idea of love comes entirely from external sources: romance novels, movies, songs, the stories older women tell. It's a beautiful fantasy, but it bears little resemblance to reality.</p>
<p>In Maria's fantasy, love happens suddenly and obviously. You see someone, your eyes meet, and you just know. There's immediate connection, perfect understanding, instant completion. The man will be handsome, devoted, successful. He'll sweep her off her feet, make all her problems disappear, give her life meaning.</p>
<p>Once married, they'll live in perfect harmony. He'll work and provide; she'll maintain a beautiful home and raise beautiful children. They'll never fight about anything important. Their passion will never dim. They'll grow old together, still deeply in love, surrounded by family.</p>
<p>This is what Maria believes love is. This is what she's waiting for.</p>
<h3>The First Warning {.diary-entry}</h3>
<p>Even in childhood, there are hints that Maria's romantic fantasy might not match reality. She sees marriages in her town that don't look like her dream. Couples who seem more resigned than passionate. Women whose eyes suggest disappointment rather than fulfillment.</p>
<p>But Maria explains these away. Those people settled for less than true love. They married for practical reasons rather than passion. They didn't wait for &quot;the one.&quot;</p>
<p>Maria will be different. She won't settle. She'll wait for real love, the kind that matches her fantasy. And when it comes, everything will be perfect.</p>
<h2>The Innocence of Youth</h2>
<p>What's most striking about young Maria is her complete innocence—not just sexual innocence (though she is that), but innocence about life itself. She has no idea how much pain love can bring. No idea how reality will challenge her fantasies. No concept of the complexity of desire, the compromises of real relationships, the ways passion and security can conflict.</p>
<p>She's a girl with a simple dream in a small town, reading books and waiting for her life to begin. She believes the difficult part is finding love—that once you find it, everything else is easy.</p>
<p>Life, of course, has very different lessons to teach her.</p>
<h3>The Path Ahead {.reflection}</h3>
<p>Looking at young Maria, with her simple dreams and romantic fantasies, it's impossible to predict the journey ahead. How could this girl who dreams only of traditional marriage and family end up in the brothels of Geneva? How could someone so innocent traverse such dark paths?</p>
<p>But the seeds are already there: the gap between fantasy and reality, the books that hint at wider worlds, the hunger for something more even as she consciously wants something traditional and safe.</p>
<p>Maria's journey will teach her that love is far more complex than her childhood fantasies suggested. That desire and connection, body and soul, pain and pleasure are all intertwined in ways her small-town upbringing never prepared her for.</p>
<p>But first, she must leave this small town behind. First, she must have her heart broken.</p>
