<h2>The Marriage Reviewed</h2>
<p>In the days following his encounter with Mikhail, the narrator finds himself haunted by memories of his marriage. He reconstructs conversations, recalls moments of intimacy and distance, tries to identify the exact moment when Esther’s eyes began to look at him with something other than love. Was it boredom? Resentment? Recognition that he did not know her?</p>
<p>These memories come in fragments—like looking at a photograph through fractured glass. He remembers the day they met, young and full of possibilities. He remembers the early years when everything felt exciting and new. But beneath these romantic memories, something else emerges: a recognition that they were never truly present to each other.</p>
<h3 class="metaphor-box">The Railway Tracks</h3>
<p>The narrator remembers a conversation with Esther in which she used an image that has stayed with him. “Marriage,” she said, “is like two railway tracks. They run alongside each other, sometimes close, sometimes farther apart, but they never truly connect. They maintain their distance precisely so they can move forward together.”</p>
<p>He did not understand what she meant at the time. He thought she was being poetic, romantic even. Now, in her absence, the image becomes devastatingly clear. Their marriage was not a true union but a parallel existence. They occupied the same spaces, performed the same rituals, but they moved along separate tracks, never drawing closer, never truly merging.</p>
<p>The tragedy of this realization is that it could have been different. But it would have required something neither of them was prepared to give: radical honesty, complete vulnerability, the willingness to question whether they truly belonged together or whether they were simply following a script written by society.</p>
<h2 class="memory-box">The Woman He Did Not Know</h2>
<p>The narrator begins to realize that he married an idea of Esther, not the real woman. He loved the image of the beautiful, intelligent, accomplished war correspondent—the woman who could hold her own in any conversation, who had seen parts of the world he would only write about. But he never truly asked who <em>she</em> was beneath the accomplishments.</p>
<p>What made Esther happy? What did she fear? What did she dream about when she was alone? He does not know. In their years together, these questions were never asked because neither of them was comfortable with radical intimacy. It was easier to admire from a distance than to truly see and be seen.</p>
<p>Esther, he now understands, was on her own journey long before she left. She was searching for something he could not give—not because he was incapable of giving it, but because she needed to find it within herself first. Her work as a war correspondent was part of this search. She was witnessing humanity in its rawest form, confronting her own mortality, questioning what truly mattered in life.</p>
<h2 class="obsession-box">The Obsession Within the Marriage</h2>
<p>In a strange reversal, the narrator realizes that his obsession with Esther did not begin when she disappeared. It began the moment he met her. But during the marriage, his obsession was disguised as love. It masqueraded as devotion and attention. In reality, it was possession without knowledge, attraction without understanding.</p>
<p>He was obsessed with what she represented—success, beauty, intellectual stimulation—not with who she was. She was his Zahir even then, but he did not recognize it because the obsession was reciprocated. Or so he thought. Perhaps Esther recognized the obsession for what it was and needed to escape before it destroyed them both.</p>
<h2 class="insight-box">The Small Cruelties</h2>
<p>In remembering their life together, the narrator identifies countless small moments in which he was unkind without meaning to be. He criticized her work, suggesting that reporting from war zones was dangerous and unnecessary. He subtly implied that his career, his writing, was more important than her journalism. He expected her to maintain a home, to be a companion when he wanted companionship, to entertain his friends, to be the ideal wife.</p>
<p>Esther endured these expectations for years. She made compromises, adjusted herself to fit into the role he had designed for her. But something in her—some essential part of her spirit—refused to be completely diminished. Eventually, that part of her could no longer stay.</p>
<h2 class="wisdom-box">The Price of Ignorance</h2>
<p>The narrator comes to a devastating conclusion: he did not cause Esther to leave through any single act or betrayal. He caused it through his fundamental unwillingness to truly know her. He loved the idea of her, not her. He was devoted to the marriage as an institution, not to the person he had married.</p>
<p>This knowledge is both liberating and crushing. It means he is not responsible for her departure in the way he feared. But it also means he has wasted years of a woman’s life in a relationship where she was never truly seen. And it means that even if she returned tomorrow, they could not resume their marriage because that marriage was built on a foundation of mutual misunderstanding.</p>
<h2 class="awakening-box">The Woman She Was Becoming</h2>
<p>Toward the end of their marriage, Esther began to change. She became more withdrawn, more contemplative. She spoke about travel, about visiting certain places, about learning new crafts. She began to talk about spirituality, about consciousness, about the meaning of life in ways that made the narrator uncomfortable because they seemed to be moving beyond the realm of words and ideas into something more intuitive and mysterious.</p>
<p>She was not becoming a different person; she was becoming herself. And as she did, the distance between them grew wider because the narrator did not know how to relate to this emerging version of Esther. His language, his education, his intellectual framework—none of it was equipped to connect with her on the level she was seeking.</p>
<h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>Can a marriage survive when one partner begins to evolve spiritually while the other remains static? Is it possible to truly know another person, or are we all ultimately strangers to those who love us? What would it have taken for the narrator to truly see Esther before she left?</p>
