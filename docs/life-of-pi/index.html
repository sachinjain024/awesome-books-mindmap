            <h2>About This Book</h2>
<p>Pi Patel survives a shipwreck and 227 days on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Martel's novel explores faith, storytelling, and the will to live—and asks which story we choose to believe when the truth is unbearable.</p>
<p>This mind map guides you through Pi's journey from Pondicherry to the Pacific, his survival with Richard Parker, and the final question about truth and meaning. Each chapter reveals how faith, routine, and the stories we tell ourselves can sustain us through the impossible.</p>

            <h3>Core Stoic Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Faith and doubt:</strong> Pi holds multiple faiths; belief does not require a single story.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Survival and meaning:</strong> The will to live is tied to story, routine, and something beyond the self.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Story and truth:</strong> We choose which story to believe; the &quot;better&quot; story can be the one that gives life meaning.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Richard Parker:</strong> The tiger can be read as fear, the self, or the unknown—what we must live with to survive.</li>
