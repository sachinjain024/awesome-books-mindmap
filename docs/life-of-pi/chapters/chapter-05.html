            <p>Pi reaches Mexico. Richard Parker leaves without looking back. Officials interview Pi and want a report. He tells the story with the tiger. They don't believe it—so he tells another story, without the tiger, without the island—a story of human brutality. Then he asks: which story do you prefer?</p>
<h2>Two Stories</h2>
<p>The &quot;other&quot; story replaces the animals with humans: the cook kills the sailor and Pi's mother; Pi kills the cook. It is a story of survival through violence. The officials note that the two stories match in structure—the same events, different characters. Pi says both are stories about what happened. &quot;So it goes with God.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And so it goes with God.&quot;
— Pi Patel, Life of Pi</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Which Story Do You Prefer?</h2>
<p>Pi does not insist that the tiger story is &quot;true&quot; in a factual sense. He insists that we choose which story we live by. The story with Richard Parker is the one that allowed him to survive with his humanity and his faith. The other story is unbearable. So we choose the better story—the one that gives meaning—and in that choice, we are like believers in God.</p>
<h3>Key Insight {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>Truth and story are not always the same. Sometimes we need the story that lets us live—that gives suffering meaning. &quot;And so it goes with God&quot;: we choose the story that we can bear and that bears us.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>We can hold two versions of events—one literal, one symbolic—and choose which to live by.</li>
<li>The &quot;better&quot; story is the one that preserves meaning and humanity.</li>
<li>Faith, like the tiger story, is a choice of how to see and how to live.</li>
</ul>
