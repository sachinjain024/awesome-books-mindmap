            <p>Pi Patel grows up in Pondicherry, India, where his father runs a zoo. Pi loves animals and stories. As a teenager he explores three religions—Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam—and decides he wants to love God through all of them. His family plans to move to Canada; they board a Japanese freighter with the animals.</p>
<h2>Faith in Many Forms</h2>
<p>Pi's parents are secular; his brother mocks him. But Pi finds something true in each tradition—the color and devotion of Hinduism, the sacrifice of Christ, the discipline and surrender of Islam. &quot;I just want to love God,&quot; he says. The pandit, priest, and imam argue; Pi refuses to choose one. Faith, for him, is not a single path.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I just want to love God.&quot;
— Pi Patel, Life of Pi</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Zoo</h2>
<p>Growing up in the zoo teaches Pi about animal nature—territory, dominance, survival. His father once made him watch a tiger kill a goat to show that the tiger is not his friend. That lesson will save Pi on the lifeboat: he knows he must establish dominance and boundaries with Richard Parker.</p>
<h3>Key Insight {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>Pi's openness to multiple faiths and his understanding of animals are both forms of seeing the world as it is—and as something more. Both will sustain him in the Pacific.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Faith can embrace more than one tradition when the aim is to love, not to own the truth.</li>
<li>Understanding animal behavior is a form of respect—and survival.</li>
<li>Stories and religion give Pi a frame for meaning that will hold during the ordeal.</li>
</ul>
