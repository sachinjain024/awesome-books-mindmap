        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>The ship sinks in a storm. Pi escapes onto a lifeboat. So do a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan—and Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger, who has been hiding under the tarpaulin. The hyena kills the zebra and the orangutan; Richard Parker kills the hyena. Pi is alone with the tiger on the Pacific.</p>
<h2>The Shipwreck</h2>
<p>Pi loses his family and everything he knew. The violence is sudden and total. He is left with the lifeboat, the supplies, and the tiger. The ocean is vast, indifferent, beautiful, and deadly. He has no choice but to adapt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I was alone and orphaned, in the middle of the Pacific, hanging on to an oar, an adult tiger in front of me, sharks beneath me, a storm raging about me.&quot;
— Yann Martel, Life of Pi</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Richard Parker</h2>
<p>The tiger is not a companion—he is a predator. But he is also the reason Pi must stay alert, find food, maintain the raft, and keep a routine. In a perverse way, Richard Parker gives Pi a reason to survive. Pi decides he must tame him—or at least establish that he is the dominant one—or he will be killed.</p>
<h3>Key Insight {.insight-box}</h3>
<p>The tiger can symbolize fear, the unconscious, or the raw will to live. Surviving with Richard Parker means accepting what we cannot eliminate and finding a way to coexist.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Catastrophe can leave us &quot;alone and orphaned&quot;—the work is to go on.</li>
<li>The presence of danger (the tiger) can force us to stay sharp and purposeful.</li>
<li>Survival begins with accepting the new reality and deciding to act.</li>
</ul>
