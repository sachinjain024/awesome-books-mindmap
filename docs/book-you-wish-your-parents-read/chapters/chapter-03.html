<p>“You cannot give your child what you never received unless you first grieve what you missed and find ways to give it to yourself.”
— Philippa Perry</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Unfinished Business of Childhood</h2>
<p>Becoming a parent often stirs up feelings about our own childhood—both what we received and what we missed. Unresolved childhood wounds don’t simply disappear when we become adults. They remain active in our emotional lives, shaping how we respond to our children, often in unconscious ways.</p>
<p>This chapter explores how to heal old wounds so they don’t interfere with the parent you want to be. Perry emphasizes that this isn’t about dwelling on the past or blaming your parents—it’s about understanding and processing your experiences so you can parent from a place of wholeness rather than deprivation.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">Why Old Wounds Matter in Parenting</h3>
<p>When your child’s needs trigger your own unmet childhood needs, parenting becomes painful. A baby’s crying might activate memories of being ignored. A toddler’s need for attention might feel overwhelming if you never received adequate attention yourself. A teenager’s independence might trigger abandonment fears.</p>
<p><strong>Common ways unhealed wounds affect parenting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over-giving:</strong> Compensating for what you lacked by giving your child everything, leading to burnout</li>
<li><strong>Emotional unavailability:</strong> Shutting down when needs feel overwhelming</li>
<li><strong>Resentment:</strong> Feeling angry at your child for needing things you never received</li>
<li><strong>Boundary confusion:</strong> Struggling to know what’s appropriate because your own boundaries were violated</li>
<li><strong>Projecting your experience:</strong> Seeing your child’s life through the lens of your own childhood</li>
</ul>
<p>The work of “repairing the past” means acknowledging what you needed but didn’t get, grieving that loss, and finding adult ways to meet those needs now.</p>
<h2>Acknowledging What You Missed</h2>
<p>Many people minimize their childhood difficulties, especially if they weren’t overtly abused or neglected. “I had it better than most people” or “My parents did their best” become ways to avoid painful feelings. While these statements might be true, they can also prevent necessary healing.</p>
<p>Perry encourages honesty about your childhood experience, separate from judgment about your parents. You can acknowledge what you missed while understanding your parents did their best with their own limitations and circumstances.</p>
<h3 class="insight-box">Common Unmet Childhood Needs</h3>
<p><strong>Emotional attunement:</strong> Being truly seen, understood, and responded to emotionally
<strong>Validation:</strong> Having your feelings acknowledged rather than dismissed
<strong>Safety:</strong> Physical and emotional predictability and protection
<strong>Autonomy:</strong> Age-appropriate independence and respect for your developing identity
<strong>Unconditional acceptance:</strong> Being loved for who you are, not just what you achieve
<strong>Repair:</strong> Apologies when adults made mistakes or caused harm
<strong>Play and joy:</strong> Lightness, fun, and freedom from adult responsibilities</p>
<p>Which of these resonate with you? What did you long for as a child that you didn’t receive?</p>
<h2>The Grief Process</h2>
<p>Acknowledging what you missed often brings grief—sadness for the child you were, anger at what should have been different, perhaps guilt for “complaining” about your upbringing. All these feelings are valid and necessary.</p>
<p>Perry normalizes this grief process. You’re not betraying your parents by feeling sad about what they couldn’t provide. You’re honoring your own experience and creating space for healing.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy grieving involves:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allowing the feelings:</strong> Don’t rush to “get over it” or minimize your experience</li>
<li><strong>Talking about it:</strong> Share with a therapist, trusted friend, or support group</li>
<li><strong>Writing:</strong> Journal about childhood memories and what you needed</li>
<li><strong>Compassion for yourself:</strong> Recognize the child you were deserved more, regardless of circumstances</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="practice-exercise">Practice: Letter to Your Younger Self</h3>
<p>Write a letter to yourself as a child, acknowledging what you experienced and what you needed. You might write:</p>
<p><em>“Dear 8-year-old me, I see how hard you tried to be good enough to earn love. I’m sorry you felt like you had to perform to matter. You deserved to be loved just for being you. You didn’t need to be perfect—you just needed to be seen.”</em></p>
<p>This exercise helps you develop compassion for your younger self and separate your experience from your identity. You were a child who needed things you didn’t get—that’s about your circumstances, not your worth.</p>
<h2>Reparenting Yourself</h2>
<p>Once you’ve acknowledged what you missed, the next step is finding adult ways to meet those needs now. This doesn’t erase the past, but it prevents childhood deprivation from controlling your present.</p>
<p><strong>If you missed emotional validation:</strong> Practice acknowledging your own feelings without judgment. “I’m feeling sad right now, and that’s okay.”</p>
<p><strong>If you lacked safety:</strong> Create physical and emotional safety in your adult life. Establish boundaries, limit exposure to chaotic environments, develop routines that feel grounding.</p>
<p><strong>If you needed more autonomy:</strong> Give yourself permission to make choices without excessive guilt or seeking approval from others.</p>
<p><strong>If you lacked unconditional acceptance:</strong> Work on self-acceptance. Notice self-critical thoughts and practice self-compassion.</p>
<p><strong>If you needed repair:</strong> You can’t change the past, but you can acknowledge to yourself what should have happened. “I deserved an apology for that.”</p>
<h3 class="example-scenario">Example: Reparenting After Emotional Neglect</h3>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Your emotions were dismissed in childhood. When you cried, you were told “Stop being dramatic” or “You’re too sensitive.”</p>
<p><strong>Adult impact:</strong> You struggle to validate your child’s big emotions because your own were never validated. Their crying feels intolerable.</p>
<p><strong>Reparenting practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Notice your own feelings throughout the day without judging them</li>
<li>Practice saying: “I’m feeling anxious/sad/frustrated, and that’s a valid response”</li>
<li>When your child cries, notice your urge to dismiss them and pause</li>
<li>Remind yourself: “My child needs what I needed—validation. I can give them what I didn’t receive”</li>
<li>After interactions, validate your own experience: “That was hard. Their crying brought up my own pain. I’m doing difficult work.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making Peace with Your Parents</h2>
<p>Healing your childhood wounds doesn’t require confronting your parents or demanding apologies (though that may be appropriate in some situations). It does require separating their limitations from your worth.</p>
<p>Perry suggests viewing your parents with adult understanding: they were shaped by their own childhoods, cultural contexts, and circumstances. This doesn’t excuse harmful behavior, but it can reduce the emotional charge around it.</p>
<p><strong>You can simultaneously:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge they did their best AND recognize it wasn’t enough for your needs</li>
<li>Feel love and gratitude for what they gave AND grief for what was missing</li>
<li>Forgive them (if you choose) AND maintain boundaries to protect yourself</li>
<li>Understand their limitations AND still wish they’d been different</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to reconcile these contradictions—human relationships hold complexity.</p>
<h2>When Professional Help Is Needed</h2>
<p>Some childhood wounds require professional support to heal. If you experienced significant trauma, abuse, or neglect, self-help alone may not be sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Consider therapy if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your childhood experiences create persistent distress in your adult life</li>
<li>You find yourself repeating harmful patterns despite awareness</li>
<li>You struggle with depression, anxiety, or relationship difficulties rooted in childhood</li>
<li>Your parenting triggers feel overwhelming and unmanageable</li>
<li>You want deeper support for the healing process</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with a therapist trained in attachment or trauma can provide the safe space and guidance needed for deeper healing.</p>
<h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>What unmet need from your childhood shows up most strongly in your parenting? How does it affect your interactions with your child? What would it look like to meet that need for yourself now?</p>
<h2>The Freedom of Healing</h2>
<p>Repairing your own past is a gift you give yourself, your child, and future generations. When you heal your wounds, you stop unconsciously passing them on. Your child’s needs become about them, not about your unmet needs. You parent from fullness rather than emptiness.</p>
<p>This work isn’t easy, and it’s never fully finished. You’ll continue discovering new layers as your children grow. But each step toward healing creates more freedom—to respond thoughtfully, to be emotionally present, to break the chains of generational pain.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unhealed childhood wounds unconsciously affect parenting</strong>, especially when your child’s needs trigger your own unmet needs</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging what you missed is not disloyal to your parents</strong>—it’s honoring your own experience and creating space for healing</li>
<li><strong>Grief for your childhood losses is a necessary part of healing</strong>, not a sign of weakness or ingratitude</li>
<li><strong>Reparenting yourself means finding adult ways to meet needs</strong> that weren’t met in childhood</li>
<li><strong>You can understand your parents’ limitations while still acknowledging the impact</strong> on you—both truths can coexist</li>
<li><strong>Professional support is valuable for significant trauma or persistent struggles</strong>—healing doesn’t have to be done alone</li>
</ul>
