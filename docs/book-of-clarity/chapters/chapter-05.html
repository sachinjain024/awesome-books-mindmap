            <h2>Getting Attention in a Noisy World</h2>
            <p>Building a great product is useless if no one knows about it. Marketing and selling are how you bridge the gap between what you've built and the people who need it. These mental models help you compete for attention effectively.</p>
        </div>
<p><div class="mental-model">
<h3><span class="model-number">26</span>Assume Most People Are Lazy but Market to Those Who Aren’t</h3>
<p>Most people won’t read your long-form content. Most won’t watch your full video. Most won’t click through your entire funnel. That’s fine—because you’re not marketing to “most people.”</p>
<p>Your marketing should filter for the engaged minority. Long content, high-effort sign-ups, and detailed information all filter out the lazy and attract those who truly care. Quality over quantity.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="first-principles">
<h4>The Filter Mindset</h4>
<p>Every step of your marketing funnel should be filtering for better customers. If everyone gets through, you’re attracting people who aren’t serious. Some friction is good—it brings you the right people.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="mental-model">
<h3><span class="model-number">27</span>All New Products Compete with Instagram for Attention</h3>
<p>You’re not just competing with other products in your category. You’re competing with Instagram, TikTok, Netflix, and every other attention-grabbing platform for a slice of your customer’s day.</p>
<p>Attention is the scarcest resource. If you can’t capture it in seconds, you’ve lost. Your marketing must be immediately compelling—not just compared to competitors, but compared to everything else fighting for attention.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="pitfall-box">
<h4>The Boring Trap</h4>
<p>“Professional” marketing is often boring. Boring loses to entertaining every time. Your B2B SaaS is competing with memes and viral videos for the same attention. Make your marketing interesting, not just informative.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="mental-model">
<h3><span class="model-number">28</span>People Evaluate Emotionally and Then Rationalize Their Decision</h3>
<p>Buying decisions are emotional first, rational second. People feel they want something, then find logical reasons to justify the purchase. This is true even for B2B decisions.</p>
<p>Your marketing should evoke emotion first: desire, fear, belonging, status. Then provide rational justifications: features, ROI, testimonials. Emotion opens the door; logic seals the deal.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="startup-example">
<h4>Example: Apple Marketing</h4>
<p>Apple rarely leads with specs. Their ads evoke feelings: creativity, freedom, belonging to a tribe of innovative people. Once you want to be an “Apple person,” you find reasons to justify the premium price.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="mental-model">
<h3><span class="model-number">29</span>Marketing Needs to Deliver More Than It Asks</h3>
<p>Every marketing interaction is a transaction. You’re asking for attention (valuable) and offering something in return. If your content, ads, or outreach don’t provide value, you’re just taking.</p>
<p>Great marketing is generous. It educates, entertains, or inspires before it asks for anything. Give first, ask later. The best marketing feels like a gift, not an interruption.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="action-insight">
<h4>The Value Exchange</h4>
<p>For every marketing touchpoint, ask: “What are we giving the audience?” If the answer is “just information about us,” you’re asking without giving. Provide genuine value—insights, entertainment, tools—before expecting anything in return.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="key-points">
<h3>Key Takeaways from Chapter 5</h3>

<li><strong>Win Attention:</strong> You compete with entertainment, not just competitors</li>
<li><strong>Lead with Emotion:</strong> People decide emotionally, justify rationally</li>
<li><strong>Give First:</strong> Deliver value before asking for anything</li>
