            <h2>Introduction {.intro}</h2>
<p>Performance reviews are among the most dreaded activities in management—both for givers and receivers. Yet Grove argues they're among the highest-leverage activities a manager can perform. Done well, a review shapes someone's performance for months or years. This chapter explains how to do them well.</p>
<h2>Why Reviews Matter</h2>
<p>A performance review is one of the highest-leverage activities available to a manager:</p>
<h3>The Leverage of Reviews {.leverage-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>A few hours of preparation and conversation</li>
<li>Affects someone's performance for 6-12 months</li>
<li>Shapes career direction and motivation</li>
<li>Documents expectations and agreements</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The performance review is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback we as supervisors can provide.&quot;
— Andy Grove</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Two Assessments</h2>
<p>Every review should include two distinct assessments:</p>
<h3>Performance vs. Potential {.comparison-box}</h3>
<p><strong>Performance Assessment:</strong>
How did they do against objectives?</p>
<ul>
<li>Results achieved</li>
<li>Quality of work</li>
<li>Meeting commitments</li>
<li>Past-focused</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Assessment:</strong>
What might they achieve?</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth trajectory</li>
<li>Capability development</li>
<li>Readiness for more</li>
<li>Future-focused</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone can have high performance but limited potential (peaked), or low performance but high potential (developing). These require different conversations.</p>
<h2>Delivering the Review</h2>
<p>Grove provides specific guidance on delivering feedback effectively:</p>
<h3>Delivery Principles {.principle-box}</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be direct:</strong> Don't bury criticism in praise</li>
<li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Use concrete examples, not vague generalizations</li>
<li><strong>Be balanced:</strong> Include both strengths and areas for growth</li>
<li><strong>Focus on behavior:</strong> What they did, not who they are</li>
<li><strong>Listen:</strong> Make it a dialogue, not a lecture</li>
</ol>
<h2>The &quot;Breakfast and Lunch&quot; Problem</h2>
<p>Grove identifies a common failure mode: managers give glowing reviews all year, then are surprised when the employee is shocked by criticism during the formal review.</p>
<h3>The Surprise Problem {.warning-box}</h3>
<p>If your review contains surprises, you've already failed. Feedback should be continuous throughout the year. The formal review summarizes and documents what should already be known.</p>
<h2>Giving Negative Feedback</h2>
<p>Negative feedback is difficult but essential. Grove's approach:</p>
<h3>Delivering Difficult Messages {.principle-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't avoid it:</strong> Failing to address problems is unfair to the employee</li>
<li><strong>Be specific:</strong> &quot;Your code reviews lack detail&quot; not &quot;You need to improve&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Explain impact:</strong> Help them understand why it matters</li>
<li><strong>Offer path forward:</strong> What specifically should change</li>
<li><strong>Follow up:</strong> Check progress on improvement areas</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Written Review</h2>
<p>Grove insists on written reviews. Writing forces clarity and creates a record.</p>
<h3>Elements of Written Review {.concept-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Summary of performance against objectives</li>
<li>Key strengths demonstrated</li>
<li>Areas requiring improvement</li>
<li>Specific development actions</li>
<li>Objectives for next period</li>
</ul>
<h2>Levels of Performance</h2>
<p>Grove suggests thinking about performance in distinct levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exceeds:</strong> Consistently surpasses expectations</li>
<li><strong>Meets:</strong> Fully meets role requirements</li>
<li><strong>Below:</strong> Not meeting some requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Be honest about which level applies. Rating everyone &quot;exceeds&quot; makes the system meaningless.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Performance reviews are high-leverage—hours of work affect months of performance</li>
<li>Assess both performance (past) and potential (future)</li>
<li>Be direct, specific, and behavior-focused</li>
<li>Reviews should contain no surprises—give continuous feedback year-round</li>
<li>Write the review—writing forces clarity</li>
<li>Be honest about performance levels</li>
</ul>
