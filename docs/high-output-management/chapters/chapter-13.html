        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Four: The Players</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Performance reviews are among the most dreaded activities in management—both for givers and receivers. Yet Grove argues they're among the highest-leverage activities a manager can perform. Done well, a review shapes someone's performance for months or years. This chapter explains how to do them well.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Reviews Matter</h2>
            <p>A performance review is one of the highest-leverage activities available to a manager:</p>

            <div class="leverage-box">
                <h4>The Leverage of Reviews</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A few hours of preparation and conversation</li>
                    <li>Affects someone's performance for 6-12 months</li>
                    <li>Shapes career direction and motivation</li>
                    <li>Documents expectations and agreements</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The performance review is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback we as supervisors can provide."

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Two Assessments</h2>
            <p>Every review should include two distinct assessments:</p>

            <div class="comparison-box">
                <h4>Performance vs. Potential</h4>
                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div class="comparison-column high">
                        <h5>Performance Assessment</h5>
                        <p>How did they do against objectives?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Results achieved</li>
                            <li>Quality of work</li>
                            <li>Meeting commitments</li>
                            <li>Past-focused</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column high">
                        <h5>Potential Assessment</h5>
                        <p>What might they achieve?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Growth trajectory</li>
                            <li>Capability development</li>
                            <li>Readiness for more</li>
                            <li>Future-focused</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Someone can have high performance but limited potential (peaked), or low performance but high potential (developing). These require different conversations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Delivering the Review</h2>
            <p>Grove provides specific guidance on delivering feedback effectively:</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Delivery Principles</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Be direct:</strong> Don't bury criticism in praise</li>
                    <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Use concrete examples, not vague generalizations</li>
                    <li><strong>Be balanced:</strong> Include both strengths and areas for growth</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on behavior:</strong> What they did, not who they are</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen:</strong> Make it a dialogue, not a lecture</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The "Breakfast and Lunch" Problem</h2>
            <p>Grove identifies a common failure mode: managers give glowing reviews all year, then are surprised when the employee is shocked by criticism during the formal review.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Surprise Problem</h4>
                <p>If your review contains surprises, you've already failed. Feedback should be continuous throughout the year. The formal review summarizes and documents what should already be known.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Giving Negative Feedback</h2>
            <p>Negative feedback is difficult but essential. Grove's approach:</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Delivering Difficult Messages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Don't avoid it:</strong> Failing to address problems is unfair to the employee</li>
                    <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> "Your code reviews lack detail" not "You need to improve"</li>
                    <li><strong>Explain impact:</strong> Help them understand why it matters</li>
                    <li><strong>Offer path forward:</strong> What specifically should change</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow up:</strong> Check progress on improvement areas</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Written Review</h2>
            <p>Grove insists on written reviews. Writing forces clarity and creates a record.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Elements of Written Review</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Summary of performance against objectives</li>
                    <li>Key strengths demonstrated</li>
                    <li>Areas requiring improvement</li>
                    <li>Specific development actions</li>
                    <li>Objectives for next period</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Levels of Performance</h2>
            <p>Grove suggests thinking about performance in distinct levels:</p>

            <div class="meeting-grid">
                <div class="meeting-type">
                    <h5>Exceeds</h5>
                    <p>Consistently surpasses expectations</p>
                </div>
                <div class="meeting-type">
                    <h5>Meets</h5>
                    <p>Fully meets role requirements</p>
                </div>
                <div class="meeting-type">
                    <h5>Below</h5>
                    <p>Not meeting some requirements</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Be honest about which level applies. Rating everyone "exceeds" makes the system meaningless.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance reviews are high-leverage—hours of work affect months of performance</li>
                <li>Assess both performance (past) and potential (future)</li>
                <li>Be direct, specific, and behavior-focused</li>
                <li>Reviews should contain no surprises—give continuous feedback year-round</li>
                <li>Write the review—writing forces clarity</li>
                <li>Be honest about performance levels</li>
            </ul>
