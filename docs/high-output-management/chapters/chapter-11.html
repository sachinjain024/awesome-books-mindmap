            <h2>Introduction {.intro}</h2>
<p>What motivates people at work? Grove explores motivation through the lens of sports and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Understanding motivation is essential because as a manager, you can't do the work yourself—you must work through others who choose to perform.</p>
<h2>Maslow's Hierarchy and Work</h2>
<p>Grove applies Maslow's hierarchy of needs to understand workplace motivation:</p>
<h3>Needs at Work {.concept-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physiological:</strong> Salary sufficient to meet basic needs</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> Job security, stable employment</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> Belonging to a team, workplace relationships</li>
<li><strong>Esteem:</strong> Recognition, status, achievement</li>
<li><strong>Self-actualization:</strong> Reaching one's potential, mastery, meaning</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a lower need is satisfied, it no longer motivates. A person earning enough to live isn't motivated by more basic salary—they want recognition, achievement, or meaning.</p>
<h2>Self-Actualization: The Highest Motivator</h2>
<p>At the highest level, people are motivated by <strong>self-actualization</strong>—the drive to become the best they can be, to achieve mastery, to fulfill their potential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Self-actualization means the need to achieve one's utter personal best in a chosen field of endeavor. Once someone's source of motivation is self-actualization, his drive to perform has no limit.&quot;
— Andy Grove</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Sports Analogy</h2>
<p>Why do athletes push themselves to exhaustion for no financial reward (in amateur sports)? Grove argues it's self-actualization—the drive to achieve their personal best. The same motivation can drive employees.</p>
<h3>What Sports Teaches Us {.example-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear goals:</strong> Athletes know what winning means</li>
<li><strong>Immediate feedback:</strong> The scoreboard doesn't lie</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> Measuring against others drives performance</li>
<li><strong>Team pride:</strong> Not wanting to let teammates down</li>
<li><strong>Mastery:</strong> The satisfaction of getting better</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fear and Achievement</h2>
<p>Grove identifies two types of motivation that drive performance:</p>
<h3>Two Motivational Drivers {.comparison-box}</h3>
<p><strong>Fear-Driven:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of failure</li>
<li>Fear of punishment</li>
<li>Works but creates stress</li>
<li>Can backfire when overused</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Achievement-Driven:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Desire for mastery</li>
<li>Pride in accomplishment</li>
<li>Sustainable and energizing</li>
<li>Creates positive culture</li>
</ul>
<p>Both can motivate, but achievement-driven motivation is more sustainable and creates better organizational culture.</p>
<h2>Creating Conditions for Achievement</h2>
<p>Managers can't directly motivate people. But they can create conditions where achievement motivation flourishes:</p>
<h3>Manager's Role in Motivation {.leverage-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set clear, challenging goals</li>
<li>Provide regular feedback on performance</li>
<li>Create healthy competition</li>
<li>Celebrate achievements publicly</li>
<li>Offer opportunities for mastery and growth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output Measures and Motivation</h2>
<p>Like sports, work needs scoreboards. People need to know how they're doing. This requires clear output measures.</p>
<h3>Good Output Measures {.principle-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Not subject to opinion</li>
<li><strong>Timely:</strong> Fast enough to enable course correction</li>
<li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Connected to what matters</li>
<li><strong>Visible:</strong> Everyone can see the score</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Motivation follows Maslow's hierarchy—higher needs emerge as lower ones are met</li>
<li>Self-actualization—the drive for mastery—is the most powerful motivator</li>
<li>Sports shows how clear goals, feedback, and competition drive performance</li>
<li>Managers create conditions for motivation; they can't inject it directly</li>
<li>Output measures are scoreboards—people need to know how they're doing</li>
</ul>
