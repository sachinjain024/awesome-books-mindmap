            <h2 class="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the book’s most important concepts: Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM). This framework explains why there’s no single “best” management style. The right approach depends on the subordinate’s maturity with the specific task at hand—and that maturity varies by task, even for the same person.</p>
<h2>What Is Task-Relevant Maturity?</h2>
<p>TRM is a combination of an employee’s experience, education, and confidence with a specific task. It’s not about general ability or seniority—it’s about readiness for <em>this particular task</em>.</p>
<h3 class="concept-box">TRM Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achievement motivation:</strong> Does the person want to succeed at this task?</li>
<li><strong>Education and training:</strong> Do they have the needed knowledge?</li>
<li><strong>Experience:</strong> Have they done this or similar tasks before?</li>
<li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Do they believe they can succeed?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The subordinate’s task-relevant maturity determines the level of supervision and involvement required by the manager. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective management style evolves.”
— Andy Grove</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>TRM Is Task-Specific</h2>
<p>A crucial insight: TRM varies by task, not by person. A senior engineer might have high TRM for coding but low TRM for project management. You must adjust your style for each task, not each person globally.</p>
<h3 class="example-box">Example: The Experienced Engineer</h3>
<p>A 10-year veteran software engineer joins your team. For coding tasks, they have high TRM—you can delegate and trust their judgment. But for your company’s specific deployment process? Low TRM. They need structured guidance until they learn your systems.</p>
<h2>Matching Style to TRM</h2>
<p>Grove prescribes different management styles based on TRM level:</p>
<h3 class="comparison-box">Management Style by TRM Level</h3>
<p><strong>Low TRM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Structured approach</li>
<li>Task-oriented supervision</li>
<li>Specific “what” and “how”</li>
<li>Frequent check-ins</li>
<li>Close monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High TRM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal involvement</li>
<li>Goal-oriented delegation</li>
<li>Specify “what”, not “how”</li>
<li>Infrequent check-ins</li>
<li>Trust and verify</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="principle-box">The Middle Zone (Medium TRM)</h3>
<p>For medium TRM, the manager is involved but differently—more supportive and communicative, less directive. Focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting objectives together</li>
<li>Discussing approaches (not dictating)</li>
<li>Providing coaching and feedback</li>
<li>Monitoring progress with less frequency</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<h3 class="warning-box">TRM Mismatches</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Micromanaging high-TRM people:</strong> They feel distrusted and lose motivation</li>
<li><strong>Delegating to low-TRM people:</strong> They fail without the guidance they need</li>
<li><strong>Treating TRM as fixed:</strong> It changes as people learn (or as tasks change)</li>
<li><strong>Applying one style to all tasks:</strong> Same person may need different styles for different tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Growing TRM</h2>
<p>TRM isn’t static. Managers can actively develop their subordinates’ TRM through training, coaching, and graduated autonomy:</p>
<h3 class="leverage-box">TRM Development</h3>
<ol>
<li>Assess current TRM for the task</li>
<li>Apply appropriate management style</li>
<li>Provide feedback and coaching</li>
<li>Gradually increase autonomy as TRM grows</li>
<li>Re-assess periodically</li>
</ol>
<h2>TRM and One-on-Ones</h2>
<p>One-on-one frequency should correlate with TRM:</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">One-on-One Frequency</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low TRM:</strong> Meet frequently (weekly or more)</li>
<li><strong>Medium TRM:</strong> Meet weekly</li>
<li><strong>High TRM:</strong> Meet less often (bi-weekly to monthly)</li>
</ul>
<p>Always be ready to increase frequency if a new task or challenge arises.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>TRM = experience, education, and confidence for a specific task</li>
<li>TRM varies by task—the same person has different TRM for different tasks</li>
<li>Low TRM requires structured, directive management</li>
<li>High TRM enables delegation with minimal oversight</li>
<li>Managers grow TRM through training, coaching, and graduated autonomy</li>
<li>Adjust one-on-one frequency to match TRM level</li>
</ul>
