                    <li><strong>Surface conflicts early:</strong> Don't hide conflicts—bring them up before they explode</li>
                    <li><strong>Propose solutions:</strong> Don't just present problems; offer recommendations</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep both informed:</strong> Proactive communication prevents surprises</li>

                    <li><strong>Escalate:</strong> If unresolvable, push the decision upward</li>
                    <li><strong>Default rules:</strong> Does the organization have a tiebreaker (e.g., "customer first")?</li>
