            <h2>Introduction {.intro}</h2>
<p>Money matters—not just as purchasing power, but as a signal. Compensation sends powerful messages about what the organization values. This chapter explores how to use compensation as a form of feedback that reinforces desired performance.</p>
<h2>Money as Message</h2>
<p>Beyond enabling people to pay bills, compensation communicates:</p>
<h3>What Compensation Signals {.concept-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>How the organization values your contribution</li>
<li>Where you stand relative to peers</li>
<li>What behaviors and results are rewarded</li>
<li>Your trajectory within the organization</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Money has a powerful significance that goes beyond its purchasing power: it's a measure of one's worth and achievement.&quot;
— Andy Grove</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Comparison Problem</h2>
<p>People inevitably compare their compensation to others. This creates challenges:</p>
<h3>Comparison Dynamics {.warning-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>People compare to peers, not to market</li>
<li>Perceived unfairness is demotivating</li>
<li>Compression (everyone paid similarly) rewards mediocrity</li>
<li>Large gaps create resentment if not justified</li>
</ul>
<h2>Performance-Based Pay</h2>
<p>Grove advocates for compensation that reflects performance differences:</p>
<h3>Performance Differentiation {.principle-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Top performers should earn significantly more</li>
<li>Raises should vary meaningfully by performance level</li>
<li>Average raises for average performance—not inflation plus</li>
<li>Be willing to give small or no raises for below-average work</li>
</ul>
<h3>Raise Differentiation Example {.comparison-box}</h3>
<p><strong>Low Differentiation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exceeds: 5%</li>
<li>Meets: 4%</li>
<li>Below: 3%</li>
</ul>
<p>Signal: Performance doesn't really matter</p>
<p><strong>High Differentiation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exceeds: 10%+</li>
<li>Meets: 4%</li>
<li>Below: 0%</li>
</ul>
<p>Signal: Performance truly matters</p>
<h2>Communicating Compensation</h2>
<p>How you communicate compensation is as important as the number:</p>
<h3>Effective Communication {.leverage-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Connect the number to specific performance</li>
<li>Explain how it compares to peers (generally, not specifically)</li>
<li>Link to future expectations</li>
<li>Be direct about what drives pay increases</li>
</ul>
<h2>When Money Isn't Enough</h2>
<p>Remember Maslow: once basic needs are met, money's motivational power diminishes. For self-actualized employees, other factors matter more:</p>
<h3>Beyond Money {.concept-box}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Challenging work</li>
<li>Recognition and respect</li>
<li>Autonomy and ownership</li>
<li>Growth opportunities</li>
<li>Meaningful impact</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compensation is a signal of value, not just purchasing power</li>
<li>Differentiate pay meaningfully by performance—sameness rewards mediocrity</li>
<li>Be willing to give zero or small raises for below-average performance</li>
<li>Communicate compensation decisions clearly, linked to performance</li>
<li>For self-actualized employees, money alone isn't enough</li>
</ul>
