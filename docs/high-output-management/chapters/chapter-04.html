        <div class="intro">
            <p>Most people complain about meetings. Grove takes a contrarian view: meetings are not interruptions to your work—they ARE your work. The key is not fewer meetings, but better meetings. This chapter provides a framework for making meetings productive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Meetings Are Necessary</h2>
            <p>A manager's work happens through meetings. Information is exchanged, decisions are made, relationships are built. Saying "meetings are a waste of time" is like a surgeon saying "operations are a waste of time."</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Before you are off and running to reorganize your life to reduce meetings, you should think about whether they are, in fact, a waste of time. My experience says they are not."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Two Types of Meetings</h2>
            <p>Grove classifies all meetings into two fundamental categories:</p>

            <div class="comparison-box">
                <h4>Meeting Types</h4>
                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div class="comparison-column high">
                        <h5>Process-Oriented</h5>
                        <p>Regularly scheduled, predictable format</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One-on-ones</li>
                            <li>Staff meetings</li>
                            <li>Operation reviews</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column high">
                        <h5>Mission-Oriented</h5>
                        <p>Called for specific purpose, ends when resolved</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Decision meetings</li>
                            <li>Problem-solving sessions</li>
                            <li>Ad-hoc discussions</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The One-on-One Meeting</h2>
            <p>Grove considers the one-on-one the most important meeting type. It's the primary vehicle for information exchange between manager and subordinate.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>One-on-One Essentials</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Weekly or bi-weekly, depending on task-relevant maturity</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> At least one hour—enough time for depth</li>
                    <li><strong>Owner:</strong> The subordinate owns the agenda and leads</li>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Subordinate's office or neutral territory, not manager's</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Mutual exchange of information and shared learning</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Why the Subordinate Leads</h4>
                <p>The one-on-one is the subordinate's meeting. They set the agenda because they know what they need help with. The manager listens, asks questions, coaches. This is far more productive than the manager interrogating.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The one-on-one should be regarded as the subordinate's meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him... The supervisor is there to learn and to coach."
                <div class="attribution">— Andy Grove</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Staff Meetings</h2>
            <p>The staff meeting is where the manager and all direct reports come together. Its purpose is different from one-on-ones.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Staff Meeting Design</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Peer interaction and group problem-solving</li>
                    <li><strong>Role of manager:</strong> Facilitator, not lecturer</li>
                    <li><strong>Ideal outcome:</strong> Subordinates learn from each other</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Status updates that could be done async</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The manager should speak less than 20% of the time. The value comes from subordinates interacting with each other, not from hearing the manager talk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Operation Reviews</h2>
            <p>These are larger meetings where knowledge is shared across organizational boundaries. Think of them as teaching sessions where one group presents to others.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Operation Review at Intel</h4>
                <p>One division presents its work to others. The audience learns; the presenters get feedback. This cross-pollination spreads knowledge that would otherwise stay siloed.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Mission-Oriented Meetings</h2>
            <p>These meetings are called to solve a specific problem or make a specific decision. They should have a clear purpose and end when that purpose is achieved.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Failure Mode</h4>
                <p>Mission-oriented meetings often fail because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The problem isn't clearly defined</li>
                    <li>The right people aren't in the room</li>
                    <li>There's no clear decision-maker identified</li>
                    <li>The meeting continues after the purpose is achieved</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Mission Meeting Rules</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Define the purpose clearly before starting</li>
                    <li>Invite only those essential to the purpose</li>
                    <li>Identify who will make the decision</li>
                    <li>End the meeting when the purpose is achieved</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Meeting Discipline</h2>
            <p>Bad meetings waste enormous amounts of organizational time. Grove insists on discipline:</p>

            <div class="leverage-box">
                <h4>Meeting Discipline Checklist</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start on time (don't punish the punctual)</li>
                    <li>Have an agenda (even if just for one-on-ones)</li>
                    <li>End with action items and owners</li>
                    <li>Cancel meetings that no longer serve their purpose</li>
                    <li>Question whether each meeting is still needed</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Meetings are the medium of managerial work—they ARE your job</li>
                <li>Two types: process-oriented (regular) and mission-oriented (ad-hoc)</li>
                <li>One-on-ones are the most important meeting; the subordinate should lead</li>
                <li>Staff meetings are for peer interaction, not manager monologues</li>
                <li>Mission-oriented meetings need clear purpose, right people, and known decision-maker</li>
                <li>Meeting discipline (agendas, timing, action items) determines productivity</li>
            </ul>
