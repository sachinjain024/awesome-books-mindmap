            <h2 class="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Two of the most difficult tasks managers face: interviewing candidates and handling the resignation of a valued employee. Both are emotionally charged and consequential. This chapter provides practical frameworks for navigating each.</p>
<h2>Part 1: Interviewing</h2>
<p>Interviewing is deceptively difficult. You’re trying to predict future performance based on a brief conversation. Most interviews fail to gather useful information.</p>
<h3 class="warning-box">Common Interview Failures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Talking more than listening</li>
<li>Asking hypothetical questions</li>
<li>Failing to probe beneath surface answers</li>
<li>Confusing likeability with competence</li>
<li>Not checking for cultural fit</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Purpose of Interviewing</h2>
<p>An interview has four goals:</p>
<h3 class="concept-box">What to Assess</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Technical knowledge:</strong> Can they do the job?</li>
<li><strong>Past performance:</strong> What have they actually accomplished?</li>
<li><strong>Discrepancies:</strong> Do their stories add up?</li>
<li><strong>Operational values:</strong> How do they work? Will they fit?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Grove’s Interview Technique</h2>
<h3 class="principle-box">Effective Interview Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Describe a project you’re proud of.”</strong> — Reveals what they value and how they think about their work</li>
<li><strong>“What were the problems? How did you solve them?”</strong> — Probes for depth beyond the surface story</li>
<li><strong>“Why did you leave your last job?”</strong> — Reveals motivation and self-awareness</li>
<li><strong>“What would you do in your first 90 days?”</strong> — Shows how they approach new situations</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your job as an interviewer is to get the candidate to reveal themselves. The best way to do this is to ask open-ended questions about their actual experience, then probe deeply.”
— Andy Grove</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Listen More Than Talk</h2>
<p>A common mistake: the interviewer talks 80% of the time, “selling” the job. Grove recommends the opposite—listen 80%, talk 20%.</p>
<h3 class="leverage-box">Interview Time Allocation</h3>
<ul>
<li>20% — You talking (about the role, company, answering questions)</li>
<li>80% — Candidate talking (about their experience, approach, questions)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 2: Handling Resignation</h2>
<p>When a valued employee resigns, it’s emotionally difficult. But how you handle it matters—both for that person and for everyone watching.</p>
<h3 class="warning-box">What’s at Stake</h3>
<ul>
<li>Losing a valuable contributor</li>
<li>Knowledge walking out the door</li>
<li>Signal to remaining team members</li>
<li>Your reputation as a manager</li>
</ul>
<h2>First Response to Resignation</h2>
<h3 class="principle-box">Step 1: Drop Everything</h3>
<p>When someone tells you they’re leaving, nothing is more important. Cancel your next meeting. Give them your full attention. This signals respect and creates space for a real conversation.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">Step 2: Listen to Understand</h3>
<p>Don’t immediately try to counter-offer. First, understand <em>why</em> they’re leaving. Often the stated reason isn’t the real reason. Listen deeply.</p>
<h2>To Counter-Offer or Not</h2>
<h3 class="concept-box">Counter-Offer Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>If it’s about money:</strong> You can counter, but ask yourself why you weren’t paying them fairly before</li>
<li><strong>If it’s about the job:</strong> Can you genuinely change what’s frustrating them?</li>
<li><strong>If it’s about management:</strong> This is feedback—can you act on it?</li>
<li><strong>If it’s about growth:</strong> Is there a real path forward here?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="warning-box">The Counter-Offer Trap</h3>
<p>Even if a counter-offer is accepted, the relationship is often damaged. The employee has mentally moved on. Statistics show most people who accept counter-offers leave within a year anyway.</p>
<h2>Learning from Departures</h2>
<p>Every resignation is a learning opportunity. Conduct a proper exit interview:</p>
<h3 class="leverage-box">Exit Interview Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What could we have done differently?</li>
<li>What did you like best about working here?</li>
<li>What frustrations did you experience?</li>
<li>What advice would you give us?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>In interviews, listen 80% and talk 20%—your job is to learn about them</li>
<li>Assess: technical ability, past performance, consistency, operational values</li>
<li>When someone resigns, drop everything and give them full attention</li>
<li>Understand the real reason before considering counter-offers</li>
<li>Counter-offers often fail—the relationship is damaged</li>
<li>Treat every departure as a learning opportunity</li>
</ul>
