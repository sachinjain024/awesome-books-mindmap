        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>As organizations scale, coordination cost rises faster than headcount. This chapter examines how talent standards, role clarity, and operating norms become decisive.</p>
<p>Culture is treated as execution infrastructure, not slogans. It becomes visible in hiring choices, meeting behavior, ownership norms, and tolerance for ambiguity.</p>
<h3>Operator Perspective</h3>
<p>High-growth environments fail less from lack of ideas and more from weak execution interfaces between teams.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Culture should be legible in everyday operating behavior.</li>
<li>Hiring and performance standards are strategy in action.</li>
<li>Alignment must be continuously rebuilt as complexity grows.</li>
</ul>
