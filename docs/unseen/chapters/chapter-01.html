        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>The book opens near Zomato's 2021 IPO moment, where external validation is highest but internal uncertainty is still active. This framing matters: it resists the standard startup script where everything looks inevitable in hindsight.</p>
<p>By beginning at the peak and then returning to earlier phases, the narrative emphasizes process over mythology. Success appears as an accumulation of contested calls, not a smooth masterplan.</p>
<h2>Why This Structure Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>It highlights the gap between public narrative and private reality.</li>
<li>It keeps attention on decisions, not just outcomes.</li>
<li>It shows that pressure does not end after milestones; it changes form.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Insight</h3>
<p>Milestones are visible. Method is usually hidden. This chapter points you toward method.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The IPO is used as an entry point, not the ending.</li>
<li>Retrospective clarity can hide the uncertainty teams actually lived through.</li>
<li>Understanding a company requires tracing major decisions back to their context.</li>
</ul>
