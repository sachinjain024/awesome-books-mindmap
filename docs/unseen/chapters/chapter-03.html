            <p>Many durable startups begin by solving a narrow, immediate problem. This chapter follows that transition from practical utility to a product that can scale beyond its initial context.</p>
<p>The early product thesis was simple: reduce friction in food discovery and ordering decisions. The execution challenge was not idea novelty but reliability, usability, and trust.</p>
<h2>What Changed the Trajectory</h2>
<ul>
<li>A repeatable user pain point with broad relevance.</li>
<li>Fast feedback loops on product experience.</li>
<li>Willingness to evolve identity and positioning as the market expanded.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>A useful product can emerge from small operational annoyances.</li>
<li>Early traction depends on removing friction better than alternatives.</li>
<li>Founding stories are less about epiphany, more about disciplined iteration.</li>
</ul>
