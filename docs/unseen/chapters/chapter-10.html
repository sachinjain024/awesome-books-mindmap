        <div class="chapter-content">
            <p>The Blinkit deal is presented as a conviction-heavy strategic bet with significant debate around timing, economics, and integration complexity.</p>
<p>This chapter explores how leadership processes controversial decisions: what evidence is used, how dissent is handled, and how commitment is communicated after the call is made.</p>
<h2>Decision Under Ambiguity</h2>
<ul>
<li>No major strategic bet arrives with complete information.</li>
<li>Internal disagreement can improve decision quality when structured well.</li>
<li>Speed after decision is as important as the decision itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>High-upside moves require tolerance for short-term criticism.</li>
<li>Strategic coherence depends on integrating new bets into the core model.</li>
<li>Leadership credibility is tested after the announcement, during execution.</li>
</ul>
