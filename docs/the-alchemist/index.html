            <h3>Core Stoic Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Personal Legend:</strong> Your true purpose in life; when you pursue it, the universe supports you.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Omens:</strong> The language of the universe; learn to read signs and follow them.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Fear of failure:</strong> Often worse than failure itself; it keeps you from even trying.</li>
                
                <li><strong>The present moment:</strong> Life is the moment we&#39;re living now; don&#39;t live in fear of loss.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Listen to your heart:</strong> It knows your dreams and speaks the language of the Soul of the World.</li>
