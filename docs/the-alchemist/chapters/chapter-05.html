        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5: The Treasure</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">The Journey</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Santiago reaches the pyramids and is tested one last time. What he discovers there—about treasure, about himself—completes the fable: the real gold is the person he became by following his Personal Legend.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>At the Pyramids</h2>
            <p>Santiago arrives at the Egyptian pyramids and begins to dig for the treasure of his dream. He is attacked by refugees who rob him. When he tells his story, one of them mocks him: he too had a recurring dream of treasure—buried under a sycamore tree by an abandoned church in Spain, where a shepherd slept.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
                <div class="attribution">— Echo of the fable's wisdom</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Real Treasure</h2>
            <p>Santiago realizes the treasure was never only at the pyramids. The dream sent him on a journey that led him to the Alchemist, to Fatima, to the desert, and to his own courage. The "treasure" under the sycamore is both literal—the chest he will dig up at home—and symbolic: the wisdom, love, and strength he gained along the way.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>The treasure you seek is often closer than you think—but you have to take the long journey to become the person who can recognize it. The real gold is who you become while pursuing your Personal Legend.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Return and Completion</h2>
            <p>Santiago returns to Andalusia, digs under the sycamore by the abandoned church where he once slept with his sheep, and finds the chest of gold and jewels. He has Fatima to return to and a life that is no longer the same—because he chose to follow his dream.</p>
