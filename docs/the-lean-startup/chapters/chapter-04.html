        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4: Experiment</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part One: Vision</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>This chapter establishes that every startup should be viewed as a grand experiment. Rather than asking "Can this product be built?" we should ask "Should this product be built?" and "Can we build a sustainable business around this product?" The scientific method provides the framework for finding answers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>From Business Plan to Experiment</h2>
            <p>Traditional business plans are treated as documents to execute. But in a startup, a business plan is really a set of hypotheses that need to be tested. Instead of writing a plan and then executing it, startups should design experiments to test whether the plan's assumptions are true.</p>

            <div class="framework-box">
                <h4>The Experimental Mindset</h4>
                <p>Think of your startup as a series of experiments. Each feature you build, each marketing campaign you run, each new market you enter is an experiment designed to test a hypothesis about your business.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The goal of every startup experiment is to discover how to build a sustainable business around that vision."
                <div class="attribution">— Eric Ries</div>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Two Most Important Questions</h2>
            <p>Before investing significant resources, every startup should answer two fundamental questions:</p>

            <div class="methodology-box">
                <h4>The Fundamental Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Do customers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>If there was a solution, would they buy it?</strong></li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>These questions seem obvious, but many startups skip them. They assume they know the answers based on their own intuition or limited conversations. The experimental approach requires testing these assumptions with real customer behavior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Zappos Experiment</h2>
            <p>Ries shares the founding story of Zappos as a perfect example of experimentation before investment.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Case Study: Zappos Tests Demand</h4>
                <p><span class="company">Zappos</span> founder Nick Swinmurn wanted to test whether customers would buy shoes online. Instead of building a warehouse full of inventory, he went to local shoe stores, took pictures of their products, and posted them online. When customers ordered, he bought the shoes from the store and shipped them.</p>
                <p><strong>The experiment tested:</strong> Would customers buy shoes without trying them on? The answer was yes—validated by actual purchases, not surveys.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This "Wizard of Oz" approach let Zappos learn about customer demand with minimal investment. They discovered not just that people would buy shoes online, but what the actual customer experience challenges would be.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Beyond "Will It Work?"</h2>
            <p>Experiments should be designed to answer specific questions about your business model, not just whether your product "works." Consider these dimensions:</p>

            <div class="metrics-grid">
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <div class="metric-name">Value Hypothesis</div>
                    <div class="metric-description">Does the product deliver value to customers?</div>
                </div>
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <div class="metric-name">Growth Hypothesis</div>
                    <div class="metric-description">How will new customers discover the product?</div>
                </div>
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <div class="metric-name">Revenue Model</div>
                    <div class="metric-description">Will customers pay, and how much?</div>
                </div>
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <div class="metric-name">Cost Structure</div>
                    <div class="metric-description">Can you deliver the product profitably?</div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Village Laundry Service</h2>
            <p>Another example demonstrates how experimentation works in non-tech contexts.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Case Study: Village Laundry Service (VLS)</h4>
                <p><span class="company">VLS</span> in India wanted to provide laundry service to people in villages who had no access to washing machines. Instead of building a full operation, they:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set up a single kiosk with a rented washer and dryer</li>
                    <li>Tested different pricing and service options</li>
                    <li>Learned about customer needs and willingness to pay</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This minimal experiment taught them about their actual customers before major investment.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Designing Good Experiments</h2>
            <p>Not all experiments are created equal. A good startup experiment has specific characteristics:</p>

            <div class="process-steps">
                <h4>Elements of a Good Experiment</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Clear hypothesis:</strong> What specific assumption are you testing?</li>
                    <li><strong>Measurable outcome:</strong> How will you know if the hypothesis is true or false?</li>
                    <li><strong>Real customers:</strong> Test with actual potential customers, not friends or family</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimum investment:</strong> Use the least resources needed to get a clear answer</li>
                    <li><strong>Actionable results:</strong> The outcome should tell you what to do next</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>An experiment that can't fail isn't really an experiment. Design tests that could prove you wrong—that's the only way to validate that you're right.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Treat your startup as a series of experiments, not a plan to execute</li>
                <li>Test whether customers have the problem and would pay for a solution before building</li>
                <li>Design experiments that test specific hypotheses with measurable outcomes</li>
                <li>Use minimal resources to get clear answers before major investment</li>
                <li>Real customer behavior is the only valid test—surveys and opinions aren't enough</li>
            </ul>
