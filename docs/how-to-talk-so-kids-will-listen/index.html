            <h3>Core Principles of This Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Feelings First:</strong> Accept and acknowledge feelings before trying to fix problems or change behavior.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Respect Goes Both Ways:</strong> Children deserve the same respect we give adults.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Describe, Don&#39;t Evaluate:</strong> Say what you see instead of judging with &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot;</li>
                
                <li><strong>Problem-Solve Together:</strong> Include children in finding solutions to conflicts.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Autonomy Builds Confidence:</strong> Let children make choices and learn from experience.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Words Matter:</strong> The way we talk to children becomes their inner voice.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Connection Before Correction:</strong> Children cooperate when they feel understood.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Progress, Not Perfection:</strong> Every positive interaction makes a difference.</li>
                
            </ul>

            <ul>
                
                <li>Replace &quot;Don&#39;t...&quot; with &quot;Let&#39;s...&quot; or describing what needs to happen</li>
                
                <li>Instead of &quot;Good job!&quot; try &quot;I see you...&quot; (describe what they did)</li>
                
                <li>When a child is upset, resist the urge to fix it and first listen and name the feeling</li>
                
                <li>Give choices whenever possible: &quot;Do you want to wear the red or blue shirt?&quot;</li>
                
                <li>Use one word instead of lectures: &quot;Teeth.&quot; &quot;Homework.&quot; &quot;Jacket.&quot;</li>
