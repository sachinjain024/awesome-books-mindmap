<h2>The Shots on Goal Mindset</h2>
<p>In any endeavor with uncertainty — which is most endeavors — the number of attempts matters enormously. You can’t control which shot goes in, but you can control how many shots you take.</p>
<p>The Stoics couldn’t control outcomes, but they could control effort and persistence. <strong>If you want more hits, you need more at-bats.</strong></p>
<h3 class="principle-box">The Mathematics of Opportunity</h3>
<p>If your success rate is 10%, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 attempts = 1 expected success</li>
<li>100 attempts = 10 expected successes</li>
<li>1,000 attempts = 100 expected successes</li>
</ul>
<p>Increasing your success rate is hard. Increasing your attempt count is a choice.</p>
<h2>Playing Games That Allow Volume</h2>
<p>Not all games are created equal. Some limit how many shots you can take. Others allow unlimited attempts. Favor the latter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply to many opportunities, not just one perfect one</li>
<li>Create content regularly, not one masterpiece every year</li>
<li>Make many small bets rather than one large gamble</li>
<li>Start multiple experiments, not one “can’t fail” project</li>
<li>Build relationships across many communities, not one exclusive circle</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reducing the Cost Per Shot</h2>
<p>To take more shots, you need to make each shot less expensive — in time, money, and emotional energy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower your standards for starting:</strong> Iterate rather than perfect upfront</li>
<li><strong>Detach from individual outcomes:</strong> Any single shot matters less when you have many</li>
<li><strong>Build reusable systems:</strong> Each shot should cost less than the last</li>
<li><strong>Shorten feedback loops:</strong> Know quickly whether a shot worked</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Stoic Perspective on Volume</h2>
<p>The Stoics emphasized that we control our effort but not our results. This principle naturally leads to a volume-based approach. If outcomes are uncertain, wisdom lies in maximizing attempts within our control while accepting that any individual attempt might fail.</p>
<p>This is not about reckless scattering of effort. It’s about strategic multiplication of opportunities.</p>
<h3 class="practice-exercise">Daily Practice: The Attempt Audit</h3>
<ul>
<li>In an area where you want success, count your attempts last month</li>
<li>Ask: Could I reasonably double this number?</li>
<li>Identify what’s making each attempt expensive (time, fear, perfectionism)</li>
<li>Find one way to reduce that cost so you can try more often</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>Are you playing games that allow for many shots? Or are you betting everything on single attempts? What would change if you optimized for volume of quality attempts?</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can’t control which shot lands, but you can control how many you take</li>
<li>Increasing attempts is often easier than increasing success rate</li>
<li>Make each shot cheaper so you can afford more</li>
<li>Favor games that allow volume over those that limit attempts</li>
<li>Strategic multiplication of opportunities is Stoic wisdom in action</li>
</ul>
