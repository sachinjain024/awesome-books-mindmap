<p>“Modern civilization is the product of fossil fuels. Replacing them will be the greatest collective challenge humanity has ever undertaken.”
— Vaclav Smil</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Fossil Fuels Still Dominate</h2>
<p>Here is the uncomfortable arithmetic of global energy: despite decades of investment in renewables, decades of climate conferences, and genuine technological progress in solar and wind power, fossil fuels — coal, oil, and natural gas — still supply approximately 80-83% of the world’s primary energy. This figure has barely changed since 1990.</p>
<p>Global CO2 emissions from energy reached record highs in 2023. The absolute increase in renewable energy generation has been real and significant, but it has been overwhelmed by the absolute increase in total energy consumption, particularly in developing countries where hundreds of millions of people are gaining access to electricity and motorized transport for the first time.</p>
<h3 class="data-box">The Scale of the Challenge</h3>
<p>To appreciate the scale of decarbonization, consider some numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The world uses approximately <strong>170,000 terawatt-hours (TWh)</strong> of primary energy per year</li>
<li>Of this, roughly <strong>140,000 TWh</strong> comes from fossil fuels</li>
<li>Solar and wind combined supply approximately <strong>4,000-5,000 TWh</strong> — about 3% of total energy</li>
<li>To replace all fossil fuels with wind and solar would require installing roughly <strong>30 times</strong> the current global wind and solar capacity</li>
<li>Current annual additions to wind and solar capacity would take <strong>150+ years</strong> at current rates to complete this replacement</li>
</ul>
<p>Smil is not making an argument against renewables. He is insisting that we understand the actual scale of what we’re attempting.</p>
<h2>The History of Energy Transitions</h2>
<p>Every major energy transition in history — from wood to coal, from coal to oil, from manufactured gas to natural gas — has taken 50 to 70 years to complete. These transitions occurred when the new energy source was demonstrably cheaper, more convenient, and more energy-dense than what it replaced. They happened in a world with a much smaller energy system than today’s.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">Why Transitions Take So Long</h3>
<p>Energy transitions are slow because the energy system is built from long-lived capital stock: power plants, pipelines, refineries, vehicles, heating systems, industrial facilities. A coal power plant built today will operate for 40 years. A gas furnace installed in a house will heat that home for 20-30 years. A steel mill designed around natural gas as a process fuel cannot simply switch to hydrogen without massive re-engineering.</p>
<p>The entire global energy infrastructure represents perhaps $70 trillion of capital investment. Replacing it requires replacing all of that capital — on a faster timeline than any previous energy transition, starting from a larger base, with technologies that are still maturing.</p>
<h2>Renewables: The Real Progress</h2>
<p>Smil is neither a renewable energy skeptic nor an uncritical enthusiast. He insists on accurate numbers. The progress in renewable energy technology and cost has been genuinely extraordinary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solar photovoltaic (PV) cost:</strong> fell by approximately 90% between 2009 and 2020</li>
<li><strong>Wind turbine cost:</strong> fell by approximately 70% over the same period</li>
<li><strong>Lithium battery cost:</strong> fell by approximately 97% since 1990</li>
</ul>
<p>This cost reduction has driven rapid deployment. In some countries — Germany, Denmark, the UK — wind and solar now supply 30-50% of electricity in favorable conditions. On sunny, windy days, some electricity grids run entirely on renewables.</p>
<h3 class="insight-box">The Intermittency Problem</h3>
<p>But electricity is not energy — it is approximately 20% of final energy use globally (the rest is direct heat and transport fuels). And electricity from wind and solar is intermittent: it is produced when the wind blows and the sun shines, not necessarily when energy is demanded.</p>
<p>Storing electricity at grid scale remains an unsolved problem. Lithium batteries are superb for short-duration storage (minutes to hours) but prohibitively expensive for the multi-day or multi-week storage needed to balance seasonal variations in wind and solar output. Smil calculates that to store just one week’s worth of US electricity consumption would require roughly 200 times the current global battery manufacturing capacity.</p>
<p>This is not an argument that the energy transition cannot happen — it is an argument that it will require technologies and solutions that do not yet exist at commercial scale.</p>
<h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>Given the true scale of the energy transition challenge — replacing 140,000 TWh of fossil fuel energy, including industrial heat and transport fuels, not just electricity — what would a realistic and honest decarbonization plan look like?</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fossil fuels still supply 80-83% of global primary energy, barely changed from 1990 despite decades of renewable growth</li>
<li>Historical energy transitions have taken 50-70 years — and today’s transition must be faster, starting from a larger base</li>
<li>Solar and wind costs have fallen 70-90% since 2009, making them the cheapest sources of new electricity generation in most of the world</li>
<li>Electricity from wind and solar is intermittent — grid-scale energy storage at seasonal timescales remains an unsolved problem</li>
<li>Replacing fossil fuels requires replacing not just electricity generation but also industrial heat, transport fuels, and chemical feedstocks — far harder than generating green electricity</li>
<li>Honest decarbonization planning requires confronting uncomfortable numbers, not just celebrating renewable energy achievements</li>
</ul>
