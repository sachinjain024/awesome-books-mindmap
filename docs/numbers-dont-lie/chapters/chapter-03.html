<p>“Engineering is the art of the possible, constrained by the physics of the necessary.”
— Vaclav Smil</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Century of Engineering Progress</h2>
<p>Technological progress is real and measurable. The question is how to measure it meaningfully. Smil’s approach is characteristic: find the right metric, track it over time, and let the numbers speak.</p>
<p>The most important insight from studying technological progress numerically is that improvement is typically gradual — measured in decades, not years — and that the dramatic leaps described in popular narratives are usually the culmination of many years of incremental improvement that nobody noticed at the time. The iPhone didn’t appear from nowhere; it was the product of fifty years of semiconductor development, twenty years of portable computing, and a decade of mobile internet infrastructure.</p>
<h3 class="data-box">The Car Engine Over a Century</h3>
<p>The internal combustion engine that powers most of the world’s vehicles has improved dramatically since its invention. Key improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1900s gasoline engines:</strong> approximately 15-20% thermal efficiency (15-20% of fuel energy converted to useful motion)</li>
<li><strong>1950s car engines:</strong> approximately 25% thermal efficiency</li>
<li><strong>Modern best-in-class gasoline engines:</strong> approximately 40% thermal efficiency</li>
<li><strong>Modern diesel engines:</strong> up to 45% thermal efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>This represents roughly a doubling of efficiency over a century of engineering. But here is Smil’s characteristic counterpoint: despite this efficiency improvement, cars today are not dramatically more fuel-efficient than cars in 1980 — because cars have gotten heavier and more powerful. The efficiency gains were consumed by increased performance and weight, not passed to consumers as fuel savings.</p>
<h2>Aviation’s Efficiency Revolution</h2>
<p>The history of commercial aviation is a story of relentless, measurable engineering progress. Jet engines have improved in efficiency by approximately 40% since the first commercial jets flew in the late 1950s. Combined with improvements in aerodynamics, materials science, and operations, fuel use per passenger-kilometer has fallen by roughly 70-80% since 1950.</p>
<h3 class="insight-box">What This Means in Practice</h3>
<p>A modern Boeing 787 Dreamliner uses approximately 2.5 liters of fuel per 100 passenger-kilometers — comparable, per person, to a fuel-efficient car. The early jets of the 1960s used four or five times as much fuel per seat-mile. This improvement is extraordinary by any engineering standard.</p>
<p>Yet aviation’s total fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have grown because the number of flights has increased so dramatically — from roughly 100 million passengers in 1960 to over 4 billion in 2019. Efficiency gains were overwhelmed by volume growth. This is the Jevons Paradox in action: making something more efficient often increases its total consumption by making it more accessible and affordable.</p>
<h2>The Computing Revolution in Numbers</h2>
<p>The exponential growth of computing power is so extreme that human intuition cannot grasp it. Moore’s Law — the observation that transistor density in integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years — has held for over 50 years, producing an approximately 1-trillion-fold increase in computing power per dollar since the 1970s.</p>
<h3 class="principle-box">The Smartphone as Supercomputer</h3>
<p>A modern smartphone has:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processing power</strong> roughly equivalent to the world’s most powerful supercomputer of 1995</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> exceeding what the entire Library of Congress could store in the 1980s</li>
<li><strong>Communication capability</strong> that would have required a room-sized installation in 1980</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apollo missions that landed humans on the Moon used on-board computers with 4 KB of memory and 32 KB of storage. Your phone has roughly 1 million times more memory and 30 billion times more storage.</p>
<h2>LED and the Lighting Transformation</h2>
<p>One of the most impactful and least celebrated technological improvements of the past two decades is LED lighting. The numbers are striking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incandescent bulb:</strong> approximately 10 lumens per watt (90% of energy wasted as heat)</li>
<li><strong>Compact fluorescent (CFL):</strong> approximately 60 lumens per watt</li>
<li><strong>Modern LED bulb:</strong> approximately 100-150 lumens per watt</li>
</ul>
<p>LEDs use 75-90% less electricity than incandescent bulbs and last 25 times longer. If all the world’s incandescent bulbs were replaced with LEDs today, it would reduce global electricity consumption by approximately 5-8% — the equivalent of eliminating hundreds of power plants.</p>
<h3 class="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>Which technological improvements happening right now are being underappreciated because they are incremental rather than dramatic? What is today’s equivalent of the LED — an improvement so obvious in hindsight that we’ll wonder why it took so long?</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Technological progress is real, measurable, and typically gradual — popular narratives of sudden breakthroughs obscure decades of incremental work</li>
<li>Car engine efficiency has doubled in a century, but weight and performance gains consumed most of the improvement — the Jevons Paradox in action</li>
<li>Aviation has reduced fuel use per passenger by 70-80% since 1950, yet total aviation emissions are growing because the number of flights keeps increasing</li>
<li>Computing power has grown by roughly a trillion-fold since the 1970s — the most extreme technological improvement in human history</li>
<li>LED lighting is one of the most impactful efficiency improvements of our era, using 75-90% less energy than the bulbs it replaces</li>
<li>Always track the right metric: total system performance and total system consumption, not just efficiency of individual components</li>
</ul>
