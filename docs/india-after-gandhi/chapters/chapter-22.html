<p>&quot;The President has proclaimed Emergency. There is nothing to panic about.&quot;
— Indira Gandhi, All India Radio, June 26, 1975</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Emergency of 1975-77 was Indian democracy's darkest chapter. This chapter examines how Indira Gandhi suspended civil liberties, jailed opposition leaders, censored the press, and ruled by decree—and how the Indian people ultimately rejected her authoritarian turn.</p>
<h2>The Emergency Proclaimed</h2>
<p>On the night of June 25-26, 1975, President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed—acting on Indira's advice—proclaimed a state of Emergency under Article 352. Opposition leaders were arrested in midnight raids. The press was censored. Democracy was suspended.</p>
<h3>The Night of the Long Knives {.historical-event}</h3>
<p>Jayaprakash Narayan, Morarji Desai, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, and hundreds of others were arrested under MISA (Maintenance of Internal Security Act). By morning, India's opposition leadership was in jail.</p>
<h2>Censorship and Repression</h2>
<p>The press was muzzled. Newspapers could only print government-approved content. Journalists who defied censorship were arrested. The BBC and other foreign media were blocked. India went dark.</p>
<h3>The Death of Press Freedom {.crisis-box}</h3>
<p>Most newspapers complied with censorship. A few—like the Indian Express and Statesman—resisted heroically. The Times of India and others became government mouthpieces. L.K. Advani later remarked that when asked to bend, the press crawled.</p>
<h2>The Twenty-Point Programme</h2>
<p>Indira justified the Emergency as necessary for economic development. She announced a Twenty-Point Programme—land reform, price controls, bonded labor abolition. Trains ran on time. Prices stabilized. Order was imposed.</p>
<h3>Efficiency vs. Freedom {.political-analysis}</h3>
<p>The Emergency's defenders pointed to economic improvements. But these came at the cost of freedom. And the improvements were temporary—once normal politics resumed, so did normal economic dysfunction.</p>
<h2>Sanjay's Excesses</h2>
<p>Sanjay Gandhi wielded enormous power during the Emergency. His pet projects—slum clearance in Delhi and forced sterilization—became symbols of Emergency brutality.</p>
<h3>Forced Sterilization {.crisis-box}</h3>
<p>To meet population control targets, officials forcibly sterilized men—often poor Muslims and lower-caste Hindus. Numbers were everything; consent was nothing. Over 8 million sterilizations were performed in 1976-77, many under coercion.</p>
<h3>Turkman Gate {.historical-event}</h3>
<p>In Delhi, Sanjay ordered slum clearance in the old city. At Turkman Gate, police firing killed residents who resisted demolition. The incident symbolized the Emergency's authoritarianism—the poor who had voted for &quot;Garibi Hatao&quot; now faced bulldozers and bullets.</p>
<h2>The Courts Fail</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court, asked to rule on the suspension of fundamental rights, ruled 4-1 that during Emergency, citizens had no right to life or liberty. Only Justice H.R. Khanna dissented. It remains the Court's most shameful moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were not mere rhetoric in the American Constitution. They cannot be mere rhetoric in ours either.&quot;
— Justice H.R. Khanna, dissenting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Khanna was passed over for Chief Justice as punishment for his dissent. His courage remains a landmark in Indian judicial history.</p>
<h2>The 1977 Election</h2>
<p>Confident of victory, Indira called elections in March 1977. The opposition united as the Janata Party. The campaign focused on Emergency excesses—the arrests, the sterilizations, the demolitions. The people delivered their verdict.</p>
<h3>The People's Verdict {.milestone-box}</h3>
<p>Congress was routed. In North India, it won barely any seats. Indira and Sanjay both lost their constituencies. The Janata Party won a massive majority. India had rejected dictatorship through the ballot box.</p>
<h2>Democracy's Resilience</h2>
<p>The 1977 election was a triumph for Indian democracy. When given the chance, the people voted out the government that had suspended their rights. The Emergency proved to be a temporary aberration, not a permanent transformation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Emergency demonstrated both the fragility and the resilience of Indian democracy—fragile enough to be suspended by executive fiat, resilient enough to be restored by the ballot.&quot;
— Ramachandra Guha</p>
</blockquote>
