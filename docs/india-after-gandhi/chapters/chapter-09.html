            <p>India’s internal boundaries were redrawn in the 1950s on the basis of language. This chapter tells the story of linguistic reorganization—how demands for language-based states, initially resisted by the central government, ultimately prevailed and reshaped India’s federal structure.</p>
<h2>The Colonial Legacy</h2>
<p>The British had organized Indian provinces for administrative convenience, not linguistic or cultural coherence. Madras Presidency included Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam speakers. The Central Provinces combined Hindi, Marathi, and other linguistic groups.</p>
<p>During the freedom struggle, the Congress had promised to reorganize states along linguistic lines. But after independence, Nehru and other leaders feared that linguistic states would encourage regionalism and threaten national unity.</p>
<h2>The Andhra Agitation</h2>
<p>The first major challenge came from Telugu speakers demanding a separate Andhra state carved from Madras Presidency. The Congress’s own 1920 reorganization had created a Telugu Congress unit—now Telugu speakers wanted a Telugu state.</p>
<h3 class="crisis-box">Potti Sriramulu’s Fast</h3>
<p>In October 1952, Potti Sriramulu, a Gandhian activist, began a fast-unto-death demanding Andhra state. After 58 days, he died. His death triggered massive riots across Telugu-speaking areas. The government capitulated and created Andhra state in 1953.</p>
<p>Sriramulu’s martyrdom opened the floodgates. If Telugus could get a state through agitation, why not others?</p>
<h2>The States Reorganization Commission</h2>
<p>Faced with mounting demands, Nehru appointed the States Reorganization Commission (SRC) in 1953. The commission, led by Fazl Ali, toured the country and submitted its report in 1955.</p>
<h3 class="political-analysis">The SRC Recommendations</h3>
<p>The commission recommended extensive reorganization along linguistic lines, but not everywhere. It opposed a separate Maharashtra-Gujarat division and rejected demands from some smaller linguistic groups. Its recommendations pleased few completely.</p>
<h2>The Reorganization of 1956</h2>
<p>The States Reorganization Act of 1956 was the largest shake-up of India’s internal boundaries. It created 14 states and 6 union territories, mostly along linguistic lines.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kerala</strong> — Created from Travancore-Cochin and Malayalam-speaking areas of Madras.</li>
<li><strong>Karnataka (Mysore)</strong> — Combined Kannada-speaking areas from multiple states.</li>
<li><strong>Andhra Pradesh</strong> — Merged Andhra with Telugu-speaking areas of Hyderabad.</li>
<li><strong>Tamil Nadu (Madras)</strong> — Reduced to predominantly Tamil-speaking areas.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Bombay Controversy</h2>
<p>The most contentious issue was Bombay. Marathi and Gujarati speakers both claimed the city. The SRC recommended a bilingual Bombay state—pleasing neither group.</p>
<h3 class="historical-event">The Samyukta Maharashtra Movement</h3>
<p>Marathi speakers launched a massive agitation for a unified Maharashtra including Bombay. The movement turned violent. Police firing killed over 100 protesters. The Congress was politically devastated in Maharashtra.</p>
<p>In 1960, the government finally split Bombay into Maharashtra (with Bombay city) and Gujarat. The issue had cost the Congress dearly, but linguistic passions were too strong to resist.</p>
<h2>The Punjab Question</h2>
<p>Punjab was another problem. Sikhs demanded a Punjabi-speaking state (Punjabi Suba), but Punjabi Hindus refused to acknowledge Punjabi as their language, claiming Hindi instead. Religious and linguistic identities were entangled.</p>
<p>Punjab was reorganized only in 1966, after Nehru’s death, creating Punjab (Sikh majority), Haryana (Hindu majority), and Himachal Pradesh. The delay contributed to Sikh alienation that would later explode into insurgency.</p>
<h2>The Consequences</h2>
<p>Did linguistic states threaten national unity? The evidence suggests the opposite. By accommodating linguistic identities within the federal structure, India defused demands that might otherwise have become separatist.</p>
<h3 class="milestone-box">Unity Through Diversity</h3>
<p>Linguistic states allowed regional cultures to flourish while maintaining national unity. State governments conduct business in regional languages, but national institutions still require Hindi or English. The federal structure accommodated diversity rather than suppressing it.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>British-era provinces ignored linguistic and cultural boundaries</li>
<li>Potti Sriramulu’s death forced creation of Andhra state in 1953</li>
<li>The States Reorganization Act of 1956 redrew India’s map along linguistic lines</li>
<li>The Bombay controversy was the most violent; city went to Maharashtra in 1960</li>
<li>Punjab was reorganized only in 1966 due to religious complications</li>
<li>Linguistic states accommodated diversity and may have prevented separatism</li>
</ul>
