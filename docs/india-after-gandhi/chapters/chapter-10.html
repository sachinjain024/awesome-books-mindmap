            <blockquote>
<p>&quot;Heavy industry is the foundation of economic development. Without it, there can be no real industrialization and no self-reliant economy.&quot;
— Jawaharlal Nehru</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nehru believed that India's poverty could only be overcome through planned economic development. This chapter examines the Five Year Plans, the massive dam projects, and the drive for industrialization—Nehru's vision of building a modern, self-reliant India through state-led development.</p>
<h2>The Planning Vision</h2>
<p>Nehru was deeply influenced by Soviet economic achievements—rapid industrialization through central planning. He believed that in a poor country, the state must guide economic development. The market alone could not lift India out of poverty.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission, established in 1950 with Nehru as chairman, became a powerful body directing India's economic development.</p>
<h2>The Five Year Plans</h2>
<p>India adopted Soviet-style five-year plans. The First Plan (1951-56) focused on agriculture and rebuilding after partition. The Second Plan (1956-61), designed by statistician P.C. Mahalanobis, emphasized heavy industry.</p>
<h3>The Mahalanobis Strategy {.political-analysis}</h3>
<p>The Second Plan prioritized steel, heavy machinery, and capital goods over consumer goods and agriculture. The theory: India must build the machines that build machines. Self-reliance required an industrial base.</p>
<p><strong>Key Statistics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3</strong> New Steel Plants</li>
<li><strong>3.5%</strong> Average Growth Rate</li>
<li><strong>$2.7B</strong> Plan Investment</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Temples of Modern India</h2>
<p>Nehru called dams the &quot;temples of modern India.&quot; Massive multipurpose river valley projects—Bhakra-Nangal, Hirakud, Damodar Valley—symbolized the new India's ambition to harness nature for human progress.</p>
<h3>Bhakra-Nangal Dam {.milestone-box}</h3>
<p>The Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River was one of the highest in the world. It provided irrigation, electricity, and flood control. Nehru inaugurated it with great fanfare—a symbol of India mastering its destiny through technology and planning.</p>
<p>Steel plants at Bhilai (with Soviet help), Durgapur (British), and Rourkela (German) were built to create an industrial base. The public sector expanded into steel, coal, heavy machinery, and other strategic industries.</p>
<h2>The Mixed Economy</h2>
<p>India chose neither pure capitalism nor pure socialism but a &quot;mixed economy.&quot; The state controlled strategic sectors; private enterprise operated in consumer goods and lighter industries. The &quot;License Raj&quot; required government permission for most economic activities.</p>
<h3>The License-Permit System {.political-analysis}</h3>
<p>To start or expand a business, entrepreneurs needed licenses. To import anything, permits. To expand production beyond licensed capacity, more permissions. This system was meant to direct investment toward national priorities but created corruption and inefficiency.</p>
<h2>Agriculture: The Neglected Sector?</h2>
<p>Critics argued that the emphasis on industry neglected agriculture, where most Indians worked. Food production grew slowly. India became dependent on American food aid (PL-480)—a humiliating &quot;ship to mouth&quot; existence.</p>
<h3>The Food Crisis {.crisis-box}</h3>
<p>Through the 1950s and 1960s, India faced periodic food shortages. The Green Revolution—high-yielding seeds, irrigation, fertilizers—would eventually solve this, but only after Nehru's death. During his lifetime, food insecurity remained a persistent problem.</p>
<h2>Achievements and Limitations</h2>
<p>The Nehruvian model achieved significant industrialization. India built an industrial base that few colonial countries possessed. Growth was respectable, if not spectacular. Poverty declined, if slowly.</p>
<p>But the model had limitations. The &quot;Hindu rate of growth&quot; (3.5% annually) barely exceeded population growth. The License Raj bred corruption. Public sector enterprises became inefficient and loss-making. Agriculture lagged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nehru's strategy achieved industrialization but not prosperity. India became capable of producing steel and generating electricity, but it could not feed its people or employ its workers.&quot;
— Economic historians' assessment</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Environmental Cost</h2>
<p>The temples of modern India had victims. Large dams displaced millions—often tribals and the rural poor. Deforestation accelerated. Pollution increased. The environmental costs of development were ignored in the rush to industrialize.</p>
<p>Only later would movements like Narmada Bachao Andolan challenge the development model. In the Nehru era, questioning big dams was almost unthinkable.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nehru believed state-led planning was essential for development</li>
<li>Five Year Plans emphasized heavy industry over agriculture and consumer goods</li>
<li>Dams were &quot;temples of modern India&quot; symbolizing mastery over nature</li>
<li>The mixed economy combined state control of strategic sectors with private enterprise</li>
<li>The License Raj created inefficiency and corruption</li>
<li>Growth was respectable but agriculture lagged and poverty persisted</li>
