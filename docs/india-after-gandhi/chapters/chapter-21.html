<p>&quot;There was no one in the party who could stand up to her. The Congress had become her personal property, to dispose of as she wished.&quot;
— Ramachandra Guha</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This chapter examines the consolidation of Indira's power after 1971, the transformation of Congress into a personal vehicle, and the emergence of Sanjay Gandhi as the Prime Minister's controversial heir apparent.</p>
<h2>Absolute Power</h2>
<p>After the 1971 election landslide and the Bangladesh victory, Indira Gandhi's authority was unchallenged. The opposition was shattered, the Syndicate destroyed, and her personal popularity at its peak. She was compared to the goddess Durga.</p>
<h2>The Transformation of Congress</h2>
<p>Under Indira, Congress ceased to be a democratic party with internal elections and became a family enterprise. Chief ministers were appointed from Delhi. Sycophancy replaced debate. &quot;Indira is India and India is Indira&quot; became a party slogan.</p>
<h3>The New Congress Culture {.political-analysis}</h3>
<ul>
<li>Organizational elections suspended</li>
<li>Chief ministers changed frequently to prevent power bases</li>
<li>Loyalty to the leader valued over competence</li>
<li>Dynastic succession normalized</li>
<li>State party units controlled from Delhi</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sanjay Gandhi</h2>
<p>Indira's younger son Sanjay emerged as her closest advisor and presumed heir. He had no official position but wielded enormous power. His interests included a car project (Maruti) and increasingly, politics.</p>
<h3>The Prince-in-Waiting {.key-figure}</h3>
<p>Sanjay was brash, aggressive, and contemptuous of democratic niceties. He surrounded himself with thugs and sycophants. His influence over his mother grew steadily. Many of the Emergency's worst excesses would be attributed to him.</p>
<h2>The Maruti Scandal</h2>
<p>Sanjay's Maruti car project received extraordinary government support—land, licenses, loans—despite his lack of automotive experience. The project failed to produce cars but generated enormous controversy and allegations of corruption.</p>
<h3>Crony Capitalism {.crisis-box}</h3>
<p>Maruti symbolized the nexus between political power and private profit. Sanjay used his mother's position to obtain favors no ordinary businessman could expect. The scandal damaged the government's reputation but Indira protected her son.</p>
<h2>The Constitutional Amendments</h2>
<p>With her huge majority, Indira pushed through constitutional amendments that strengthened central power and limited judicial review. The 42nd Amendment, passed during the Emergency, was the most sweeping—fundamentally altering the Constitution's structure.</p>
<h3>Concentrating Power {.political-analysis}</h3>
<p>Constitutional amendments during this period limited property rights, restricted judicial review of constitutional amendments, and increased central control over states. The independence of institutions—courts, bureaucracy, police—was eroded.</p>
<h2>The Cult of Personality</h2>
<p>Congress propaganda increasingly portrayed Indira as the sole leader, the embodiment of the nation. Opposition was treated as anti-national. The media—largely government-controlled—amplified the cult.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Congress party had once been a vibrant organization that nurtured debate and produced leaders. Under Indira, it became a cheering squad for one person.&quot;
— Ramachandra Guha</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Gathering Discontent</h2>
<p>Yet beneath the surface, discontent was building. Economic performance was disappointing. Corruption was visible. The promises of &quot;Garibi Hatao&quot; remained unfulfilled. Regional movements demanded autonomy. Students and workers grew restless.</p>
<p>The JP movement would channel this discontent into a challenge that threatened Indira's power—leading to the Emergency that would define her legacy.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>After 1971, Indira's power was absolute and unchallenged</li>
<li>Congress was transformed from a democratic party to a family enterprise</li>
<li>Sanjay Gandhi emerged as unofficial heir with enormous informal power</li>
<li>The Maruti scandal symbolized crony capitalism</li>
<li>Constitutional amendments concentrated power and limited checks</li>
<li>Despite dominance, economic failures and corruption bred discontent</li>
</ul>
