<p>“The Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religious philosophies, social customs, litteratures. They neither intermarry nor interdine together and, indeed, they belong to two different civilizations.”
— Muhammad Ali Jinnah, 1940</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The partition of British India into India and Pakistan was one of the most traumatic events of the twentieth century. This chapter examines how and why the subcontinent was divided, and the catastrophic human cost of that division.</p>
<h2>The Two-Nation Theory</h2>
<p>The intellectual foundation of partition was the “Two-Nation Theory”—the idea that Hindus and Muslims constituted two separate nations that could not coexist in a single state. This theory, championed by the Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, held that religious differences were fundamental and irreconcilable.</p>
<p>The Congress party, led by Gandhi and Nehru, rejected this theory. They envisioned a united, secular India where people of all faiths could live together. But the failure to find a power-sharing arrangement ultimately led to the acceptance of partition.</p>
<h2>The Radcliffe Line</h2>
<p>Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a British lawyer who had never visited India, was given just five weeks to draw the borders between India and Pakistan. He divided Punjab and Bengal based primarily on religious demographics, but the boundaries inevitably left minorities on the wrong side.</p>
<h3 class="crisis-box">The Impossible Task</h3>
<p>Radcliffe worked with inadequate maps, outdated census data, and impossible time constraints. Villages were split in half. Rivers that had served as natural boundaries became contested. The boundary award was kept secret until after independence, ensuring maximum chaos when it was finally revealed.</p>
<h2>The Great Migration</h2>
<p>The announcement of partition triggered the largest mass migration in human history. An estimated 15 million people crossed the new borders—Hindus and Sikhs moving to India, Muslims to Pakistan. The migration was accompanied by horrific violence.</p>
<p><strong>Key Statistics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>15M</strong> People Displaced</li>
<li><strong>1M+</strong> Deaths Estimated</li>
<li><strong>75K+</strong> Women Abducted</li>
</ul>
<p>Entire communities that had lived together for centuries turned on each other. Trains arrived at stations with all passengers massacred. Women were abducted, raped, and sometimes killed by their own families to preserve “honor.” The violence was not one-sided—Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs all committed and suffered atrocities.</p>
<h2>Punjab: The Epicenter</h2>
<p>The worst violence occurred in Punjab, which was divided between India and Pakistan. The province had a mixed population of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, with no clear demographic majority in many areas. The Sikh community, concentrated in central Punjab, was particularly devastated by the division.</p>
<h3 class="historical-event">The Killing Trains</h3>
<p>Trains became symbols of partition’s horror. Refugee trains crossing the border would arrive with all passengers slaughtered—“ghost trains” carrying only corpses. Both sides committed these atrocities. The railway stations of Lahore and Amritsar became killing fields.</p>
<h2>Bengal: A Different Story</h2>
<p>Bengal, also divided, saw less immediate violence than Punjab, partly due to Gandhi’s presence in Calcutta. His fasts and appeals helped maintain an uneasy peace. However, the division of Bengal had lasting economic and cultural consequences.</p>
<p>East Bengal (which became East Pakistan, later Bangladesh) was predominantly Muslim but included millions of Hindus. The migration from Bengal was more gradual, continuing for decades after partition. Calcutta, once the second city of the British Empire, was cut off from its hinterland.</p>
<h2>The Question of Blame</h2>
<p>Historians continue to debate responsibility for partition. Was it the inevitable result of Hindu-Muslim differences? The failure of Congress to accommodate Muslim aspirations? British divide-and-rule policies? Jinnah’s intransigence? Nehru’s unwillingness to share power?</p>
<h3 class="political-analysis">Multiple Causes</h3>
<p>Guha suggests that partition resulted from a combination of factors: the British acceleration of the timetable, the Congress’s underestimation of Muslim fears, Jinnah’s brinkmanship, and the collapse of law and order in the final months of British rule. No single actor bears sole responsibility.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Two-Nation Theory held that Hindus and Muslims were fundamentally incompatible nations</li>
<li>The Radcliffe Line was drawn hastily by someone with no knowledge of India</li>
<li>15 million people were displaced—the largest migration in human history</li>
<li>An estimated one million or more died in partition violence</li>
<li>Punjab bore the worst of the violence; Bengal was relatively calmer</li>
<li>Responsibility for partition is shared among British, Congress, and Muslim League</li>
</ul>
