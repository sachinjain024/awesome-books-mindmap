        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 23: The Janata Interlude</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part IV: A Fourth Revolution (1977-1991)</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The Janata Party government (1977-1980) was India's first non-Congress government at the Centre. This chapter examines its formation, achievements, failures, and the internal squabbles that brought it down—paving the way for Indira Gandhi's return.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Victory Coalition</h2>
            <p>The Janata Party was a merger of opposites—socialists, Hindu nationalists, former Congress leaders, and agrarian parties. United only by opposition to Indira and the Emergency, they had little else in common.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>Strange Bedfellows</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Congress (O):</strong> Old Congress conservatives</li>
                    <li><strong>BLD:</strong> Charan Singh's farmer party</li>
                    <li><strong>Jan Sangh:</strong> Hindu nationalists (future BJP)</li>
                    <li><strong>Socialists:</strong> Various socialist factions</li>
                    <li><strong>CFD:</strong> Jagjivan Ram's Congress breakaway</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Morarji Desai</h2>
            <p>Morarji Desai, the 81-year-old former Congressman, became Prime Minister. He was honest and austere but rigid and humorless. His cabinet included rivals who barely tolerated each other.</p>

            <div class="key-figure">
                <h4>The Reluctant PM</h4>
                <p>Desai had waited decades for the job. But at 81, he lacked the energy and flexibility for coalition management. His prohibition crusade and insistence on urine therapy made him a subject of mockery. His government struggled from the start.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Restoring Democracy</h2>
            <p>The Janata government's greatest achievement was restoring democratic norms. Political prisoners were released. Press freedom was restored. The 42nd Amendment's worst provisions were repealed. The judiciary's independence was reaffirmed.</p>

            <div class="milestone-box">
                <h4>The 44th Amendment</h4>
                <p>This amendment made it harder to declare Emergency, protected fundamental rights, and strengthened judicial review. It repaired much of the constitutional damage done during the Emergency.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The RSS Controversy</h2>
            <p>The Jan Sangh members' relationship with the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) became a constant source of friction. Socialists demanded that Jan Sangh members give up RSS membership; they refused.</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>The Dual Membership Issue</h4>
                <p>Could Jan Sangh leaders remain both Janata members and RSS members? The issue was never resolved. It poisoned relations within the coalition and provided ammunition for those wanting to break up the party.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Personal Rivalries</h2>
            <p>Charan Singh, the ambitious farmer leader, wanted to be Prime Minister. He maneuvered against Desai, allied with Indira, and eventually brought down the government. Personal ambition trumped collective interest.</p>

            <div class="timeline">
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <h4><span class="year">July 1979</span> — Government Falls</h4>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Policy Failures</h2>
            <p>Beyond restoring democracy, the Janata government achieved little. Economic policy was confused. Different ministers pulled in different directions. Implementation was poor. The government was seen as weak and directionless.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>Lost Opportunity</h4>
                <p>The Janata government had a mandate to reform India—to liberalize the economy, decentralize power, strengthen federalism. It did none of these. The opportunity was squandered on personal quarrels.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Indira's Return</h2>
            <p>The 1980 election brought Indira back to power with a massive majority. The Janata experiment had failed. Indians, disappointed with chaos, returned to the leader they had rejected just three years earlier.</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "The Janata interlude demonstrated that opposition to Congress was not the same as the ability to govern. The coalition that could defeat Indira could not agree on what to do with power."
