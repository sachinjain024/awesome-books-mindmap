            <h2>More Than One Feeling</h2>
            <p>"I'm so angry I hate everyone!" "I'm the worst at everything!" "I'll never be happy again!"</p>
            <p>When children are overwhelmed by one emotion, they often believe that emotion is all there is. They lose sight of the many other parts of themselves. This chapter is about helping children recognize that they contain multitudes—and that feelings are visitors, not permanent residents.</p>

<h3>The Wheel of Awareness</h3>
<p>Imagine a wheel. The hub is the part of you that can notice things—your awareness. The rim contains everything you can pay attention to: feelings, thoughts, sensations, memories, perceptions.</p>
<p>When we’re stuck on one point on the rim (like anger or fear), we lose perspective. The goal is to return to the hub—the observing self—from where we can see all the different parts of our experience.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="section">
<h2>States vs. Traits</h2>
<p>Children often confuse temporary states with permanent traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I’m angry” becomes “I’m an angry person”</li>
<li>“I failed the test” becomes “I’m stupid”</li>
<li>“My friend was mean” becomes “Nobody likes me”</li>
<li>“I feel sad” becomes “I’ll always feel this way”</li>
</ul>
<p>A crucial insight for children: <strong>feelings are temporary states, not permanent identities</strong>. You can feel angry without being an angry person. You can feel sad while also having the capacity for joy.</p>

<h4>Let the Clouds of Emotion Roll By</h4>
<p>Teach children that emotions are like weather—they pass through. Right now it might be stormy, but storms always end. Help them observe emotions without being overwhelmed by them.</p>
<p><strong>The mindset:</strong> “I am not my feelings. I am the one who has feelings.”</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="dialogue-example">
<h4>Clouds of Emotion in Action</h4>
<div class="dialogue-line child">
<span class="speaker">Child:</span> (Sobbing) “I’m going to feel this bad forever! I’ll never be happy again!”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line parent">
<span class="speaker">Parent:</span> “Right now you’re feeling really, really sad. That’s like a storm inside. Do you remember what happens after storms?”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line child">
<span class="speaker">Child:</span> “They… stop?”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line parent">
<span class="speaker">Parent:</span> “That’s right. Feelings are like that too. This sad feeling is real, and it hurts, but it won’t last forever. It will pass through, like clouds rolling by.”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line parent">
<span class="speaker">Parent:</span> “Can you remember a time you felt happy? Even a small one?”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line child">
<span class="speaker">Child:</span> (Thinking) “…When we got ice cream yesterday.”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line parent">
<span class="speaker">Parent:</span> “So you have happy inside you too, even if you can’t feel it right now. The sadness is visiting, but it’s not the only thing in there.”
</div>
</div></p>
<p><div class="section">
<h2>The Integration of Self</h2>
<p>A healthy sense of self includes many parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple emotions (I can feel sad AND hopeful)</li>
<li>Multiple aspects (I’m a student, a friend, a daughter, an artist…)</li>
<li>Past, present, and future selves connected</li>
<li>Both strengths and weaknesses acknowledged</li>
</ul>
<p>When children are stuck in one part, we help them by reminding them of the other parts—without dismissing what they’re currently feeling.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="strategy-box" data-strategy="Strategy #9">
<h4>SIFT: Pay Attention to What’s Inside</h4>
<p>Teach children to SIFT through their internal experience:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
<li><strong>S</strong>ensations: What does my body feel?</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>mages: What pictures are in my mind?</li>
<li><strong>F</strong>eelings: What emotions am I experiencing?</li>
<li><strong>T</strong>houghts: What am I telling myself?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The benefit:</strong> When children can identify what’s happening inside, they gain power over it rather than being controlled by it.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="dialogue-example">
<h4>SIFTing in Action</h4>
<div class="dialogue-line parent">
<span class="speaker">Parent:</span> “You seem really upset. Can we SIFT through what’s happening inside?”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line parent">
<span class="speaker">Parent:</span> “First, Sensations—what does your body feel like?”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line child">
<span class="speaker">Child:</span> “My tummy hurts. And my hands are squeezy.”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line parent">
<span class="speaker">Parent:</span> “Okay. Now Images—is there a picture in your mind?”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line child">
<span class="speaker">Child:</span> “I keep seeing Emma laughing at me when I missed the ball.”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line parent">
<span class="speaker">Parent:</span> “I see. What about Feelings?”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line child">
<span class="speaker">Child:</span> “Embarrassed. And mad at Emma.”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line parent">
<span class="speaker">Parent:</span> “And Thoughts—what are you telling yourself?”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line child">
<span class="speaker">Child:</span> “That I’m terrible at sports and everyone thinks I’m a loser.”
</div>
<div class="dialogue-line parent">
<span class="speaker">Parent:</span> “That’s a pretty harsh thought. Do you think that’s all true, or is that the embarrassment talking?”
</div>
</div></p>
<p><div class="brain-insight">
<h4>Why SIFT Works</h4>
<p>When children learn to observe their internal experience, they engage the prefrontal cortex—the observing, thinking brain. This creates distance from the overwhelming emotion. Instead of “I AM angry,” it becomes “I am noticing that I feel angry.” This subtle shift is enormously powerful.</p>
<p>It’s the beginning of mindfulness—the ability to observe one’s own mind.</p>
</div></p>
<p><div class="age-tips">
<h4>Age-Appropriate Approaches</h4>
<p><span class="age-range">Toddlers/Preschoolers</span> Focus on simple body sensations and basic emotions. “Where do you feel the mad? Show me on your body.”</p>
<p><span class="age-range">School-age</span> Can begin using SIFT language. May enjoy the “clouds” metaphor. Can start recognizing the difference between feelings and facts.</p>
<p><span class="age-range">Tweens/Teens</span> Can engage more deeply with self-observation. May benefit from journaling. Help them notice when they’re generalizing (“always,” “never,” “everyone”).</p>
</div></p>

<h2>Modeling Integration</h2>
<p>Children learn integration by watching you. When you model having multiple feelings, accepting your different parts, and observing your own experience, you teach by example:</p>
<ul>
<li>“I’m frustrated about this, but I’m also excited about finding a solution.”</li>
<li>“Part of me wants to quit, but another part wants to keep trying.”</li>
<li>“I notice I’m feeling really tense right now—my shoulders are tight.”</li>
<li>“I felt angry, but I took some breaths and now I’m calmer.”</li>
</ul>
</div></p>
<p><div class="whole-brain-summary">
<h4>The Integrated Self</h4>
<p>When children develop an integrated sense of self, they can hold complexity. They know they contain many feelings, many parts, many possibilities. They’re not defined by any single emotion or experience. This integration provides resilience—the capacity to weather storms because they know storms pass.</p>
