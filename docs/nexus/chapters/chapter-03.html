<p>“In the modern world, if it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen. And if it is documented, it happened—even if it didn’t.”
— Nexus, Chapter 3</p>

<h2>When Information Became Permanent</h2>
<p>For most of human history, information existed only in human minds. When someone died, their knowledge died with them. Then, around 5,000 years ago, humans invented writing. This changed everything.</p>
<p>Written documents allowed information to outlive individuals. A law written on clay tablets could govern generations. A religious text could spread across continents. A bureaucratic record could track citizens across lifetimes. The “paper tiger” developed teeth.</p>
<h3 class="concept-box">The Paradox of Documents</h3>
<p>Documents were created to serve humans—to record debts, preserve laws, transmit knowledge. But over time, <strong>humans began serving documents</strong>.</p>
<p>We organize our lives around birth certificates, diplomas, contracts, and tax records. The document doesn’t describe reality; it <em>creates</em> a reality that we must conform to.</p>
<h2>The Birth of Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Writing enabled bureaucracy—large organizations that process information according to fixed rules. Bureaucracies are information machines: they take in data, apply procedures, and produce outputs (decisions, classifications, permissions).</p>
<p>The ancient empires of Egypt, China, and Rome were built on bureaucracy. Without written records, you cannot collect taxes from millions, conscript armies, or administer laws across vast territories.</p>
<h3 class="historical-example">The First Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>The earliest writing wasn’t poetry or philosophy—it was accounting. The Sumerians invented cuneiform primarily to track grain, livestock, and debts. The first “authors” were bureaucrats recording who owed what to whom.</p>
<p>This reveals something fundamental: information systems emerge to serve power. The capacity to record, store, and retrieve information is the capacity to govern.</p>
<h2>How Documents Reshape Reality</h2>
<p>Harari argues that documents don’t just record reality—they actively construct it. Consider these examples:</p>
<h3 class="network-box">Identity, Property, Credentials, and Finance</h3>
<p><strong>Identity Documents:</strong> Your legal identity is not your physical body but your documented self—the name, birthdate, and number on official records. You exist legally only insofar as documents say you do.</p>
<p><strong>Property Records:</strong> Who “owns” a piece of land? Whoever the documents say owns it. The deed creates ownership; ownership doesn’t create the deed.</p>
<p><strong>Educational Credentials:</strong> A diploma certifies knowledge, but often the diploma matters more than the knowledge. You can know everything a PhD knows, but without the document, you’re not a “doctor.”</p>
<p><strong>Financial Records:</strong> Money today exists primarily as numbers in databases. Your wealth is whatever the bank’s documents say it is. The numbers are the reality.</p>
<h2>The Documentary Regime</h2>
<p>We live under what might be called a “documentary regime”—a system where documents have enormous power over human lives. You cannot work, travel, marry, or own property without the right documents. Refugees fleeing for their lives are turned back because they lack proper paperwork.</p>
<p>This creates a hierarchy: those who control documents control people. The power to issue, revoke, or modify documents is the power to include or exclude, to grant rights or deny them.</p>
<h2>The Errors of Documentation</h2>
<p>Documents claim authority and permanence, but they are created by fallible humans and fallible systems. Errors creep in. And once an error is documented, it becomes very hard to correct.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Entry Mistakes:</strong> A typo can change your identity, your credit score, your criminal record</li>
<li><strong>Categorical Violence:</strong> Documents force complex realities into rigid categories that may not fit</li>
<li><strong>Outdated Information:</strong> Documents persist long after circumstances change</li>
<li><strong>Deliberate Falsification:</strong> Documents can be forged, manipulated, or selectively created</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="warning-box">The Kafka Problem</h3>
<p>Franz Kafka’s novels depict individuals crushed by bureaucratic systems that follow their own inscrutable logic. This isn’t just fiction. When documents contradict human reality, it’s usually the human who must adjust. Try telling a border agent that your passport is wrong but you’re still you.</p>
<h2>Digital Documents: Amplification</h2>
<p>The digital revolution has amplified the power of documents exponentially. Digital records are easier to create, copy, search, and analyze than paper records ever were. This brings both opportunities and dangers:</p>
<h3 class="ai-insight">From Documents to Data</h3>
<p>We’ve moved from a world of documents to a world of data. Every click, purchase, and movement generates records that feed into vast databases. AI systems analyze this data to make decisions about loans, jobs, insurance, and criminal justice.</p>
<p>The documentary regime has become a <strong>data regime</strong>—and it’s far more pervasive than anything Kafka imagined.</p>
<h2>Who Controls the Records?</h2>
<p>The crucial question is: who controls the documentary infrastructure? In the past, governments held this power through registries, archives, and identification systems. Today, power is increasingly shared with—or captured by—corporations.</p>
<p>Google, Facebook, and Amazon maintain records about us that are far more detailed than any government database. The question of who controls information infrastructure is becoming the central political question of our time.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documents Create Reality:</strong> Written records don’t just describe the world—they actively construct social reality</li>
<li><strong>Bureaucracy = Information Processing:</strong> Large-scale organization depends on the capacity to create, store, and process documents</li>
<li><strong>The Documentary Regime:</strong> Modern life is governed by documents; without proper paperwork, you barely exist legally</li>
<li><strong>Errors Persist:</strong> Documentary systems are fallible, but their errors are hard to correct</li>
<li><strong>Digital Amplification:</strong> The shift from documents to data vastly expands the power of information systems over human lives</li>
