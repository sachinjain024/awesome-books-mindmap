<p>&quot;Prevention is the most loving form of pediatric care.&quot;
— Dr. Saroja Balan</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why Prevention Comes First</h2>
<p>The chapter positions preventive care as the backbone of child health. Regular pediatric reviews identify nutrition, growth, developmental, and risk issues before they become serious.</p>
<h2>Vaccination Confidence</h2>
<p>Parents are guided through the logic of immunization schedules, expected minor reactions, and common myths. The book emphasizes that vaccines protect both individual children and community health.</p>
<h2>Growth Monitoring and Counseling</h2>
<p>Routine checkups are not just for illness. They provide opportunities to review feeding, sleep, developmental progress, oral care, and safety planning at each stage.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vaccine adherence prevents severe, avoidable disease</li>
<li>Follow-up visits are for optimization, not only emergencies</li>
<li>Mild post-vaccine symptoms are often expected and manageable</li>
<li>Reliable medical guidance should outweigh rumor-driven decisions</li>
</ul>
