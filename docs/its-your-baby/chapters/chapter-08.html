<p>&quot;Timely care is not panic. Delayed care is not bravery.&quot;
— Dr. Saroja Balan</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Decision-Making Under Stress</h2>
<p>Parents often struggle with two opposite mistakes: rushing to emergency care for minor symptoms or delaying consultation during serious illness. This chapter provides a balanced framework for escalation.</p>
<h2>Red Flags That Need Immediate Attention</h2>
<p>Persistent high fever in very young infants, breathing difficulty, poor feeding with low urine output, unusual drowsiness, recurrent vomiting, seizures, and signs of dehydration are treated as urgent indicators.</p>
<h2>Practical Escalation Pathway</h2>
<p>The chapter recommends documenting symptom timeline, temperature records, medication doses, and feeding/urine patterns before consultation. This improves clinical decisions and reduces diagnostic delay.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Confidence comes from criteria, not guesswork</li>
<li>Urgent signs must override social reassurance or online advice</li>
<li>Good symptom tracking improves quality of care</li>
<li>Parents should trust concern when a child appears significantly different from baseline</li>
</ul>
