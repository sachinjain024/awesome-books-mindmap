<h2>Milestones as Guidance, Not Competition</h2>
<p>The chapter explains gross motor, fine motor, language, and social milestones as developmental ranges. Parents are encouraged to monitor progress trends rather than compare children rigidly.</p>
<h2>Everyday Brain-Building</h2>
<p>Talking, eye contact, touch, play, and predictable caregiving strengthen neural pathways in the first two years. Repetition and responsive interaction are highlighted as the foundation for learning and emotional security.</p>
<h2>When to Seek Assessment</h2>
<p>Persistent delays in movement, communication, eye contact, or social responsiveness should be discussed early with a pediatrician. Early intervention improves outcomes and reduces long-term complications.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Milestones should be tracked as patterns over time</li>
<li>Daily interaction is the strongest early developmental input</li>
<li>Early detection matters more than delayed reassurance</li>
<li>Parents can support development through ordinary routines</li>
</ul>
