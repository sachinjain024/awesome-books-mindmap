<p>&quot;The first job of a new parent is not perfection, but presence.&quot;
— Dr. Saroja Balan</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The First Transition</h2>
<p>The arrival of a baby changes every routine in the home. Sleep patterns shift, decisions feel urgent, and advice comes from all directions. This chapter grounds parents in a realistic starting point: uncertainty is normal, and confidence grows through observation and consistency.</p>
<h2>Building a Safe Beginning</h2>
<p>Early care should prioritize feeding, warmth, hygiene, and emotional bonding. Skin-to-skin contact, responsive holding, and gentle routines support both physical regulation and attachment. Parents are encouraged to trust daily signals from the baby instead of overreacting to isolated events.</p>
<h2>Family Systems and Support</h2>
<p>New parent stress often comes from fatigue and conflicting guidance. The chapter recommends assigning practical roles among caregivers, limiting unhelpful input, and maintaining communication between partners and grandparents.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Early parenting is a learning phase, not a performance test</li>
<li>Stability in basic routines improves infant comfort and parental confidence</li>
<li>Emotional availability matters as much as technical care</li>
<li>A coordinated support system reduces avoidable stress</li>
</ul>
