<p>&quot;Convenience should never quietly replace healthy childhood habits.&quot;
— Dr. Saroja Balan</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The New Risk Landscape</h2>
<p>Modern parenting includes challenges previous generations did not face at this intensity: screen overexposure, processed foods, reduced outdoor play, and pollution. The chapter reframes these as modifiable risks rather than unavoidable realities.</p>
<h2>Screen Hygiene in Early Years</h2>
<p>Excess screen exposure is linked to poorer sleep, language delay risk, and reduced attention. The book recommends age-appropriate boundaries, caregiver-led interaction, and screen-free routines around sleep and meals.</p>
<h2>Nutrition and Activity Patterns</h2>
<p>Early feeding habits shape taste, metabolism, and long-term weight trends. Parents are encouraged to prioritize whole foods, reduce sugar dependence, and normalize movement and play as part of daily routine.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lifestyle habits formed early often persist into later childhood</li>
<li>Screens should be intentional, limited, and developmentally appropriate</li>
<li>Family food culture influences obesity risk more than occasional treats</li>
<li>Consistent routines outperform one-time corrective efforts</li>
</ul>
