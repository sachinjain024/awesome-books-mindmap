<h2>Feeding as the Core Health Indicator</h2>
<p>The chapter frames feeding as the most practical daily measure of infant wellness. Whether breastfeeding, formula feeding, or mixed feeding, the objective is the same: adequate intake, steady growth, and a settled baby between feeds.</p>
<h2>Practical Breastfeeding Guidance</h2>
<p>Parents are guided on latch basics, frequency, and common early problems such as sore nipples, perceived low supply, and cluster feeding. The emphasis is on technique correction and support rather than guilt.</p>
<h2>Formula and Mixed Feeding</h2>
<p>When breastfeeding is insufficient or not possible, formula is presented as a valid, structured option. The chapter covers hygienic preparation, appropriate quantities, and responsive pacing.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feeding choice should prioritize safety and sustainability</li>
<li>Diaper output and weight gain are stronger signals than assumptions</li>
<li>Early feeding struggles are common and usually manageable</li>
<li>Timely support prevents minor feeding issues from escalating</li>
</ul>
