            <h2>About This Mind Map</h2>
<p>Richard Bach’s fable follows a seagull who refuses to live only for food and survival. Jonathan chooses to master flight for its own sake-and in doing so, breaks free from the flock and discovers a higher realm of possibility and purpose.</p>

            <h3>Core Teachings</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Excellence for its own sake:</strong> Pursue mastery not for reward but for the joy of the craft.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Break from the flock:</strong> Conformity limits growth; sometimes you must leave to find your path.</li>
                
                <li><strong>You are free:</strong> The only thing standing between you and your potential is the belief that you are limited.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Love and forgiveness:</strong> The only law that matters; use them to lift others.</li>
