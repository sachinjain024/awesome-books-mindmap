        <div class="chapter-meta">A Man Called Ove</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Ove finds new reasons to live: Parvaneh's family, the cat, the neighborhood, the memory of Sonja. He is still grumpy—but he is needed and loved. The novel moves forward in time: Ove grows old. He dies eventually—of natural causes, in his sleep—surrounded by the people and the cat who have become his family. The story ends with the neighborhood carrying on, shaped by the man who thought he had nothing left to give.</p>

            <h2>Staying</h2>
            <p>Ove stops planning to end his life. He doesn't announce it—he just keeps showing up. He drives Parvaneh to the hospital when she goes into labor. He takes in the cat. He helps Rune and Anita. He becomes a grandfather figure to Parvaneh's daughters. Purpose has returned—not as a replacement for Sonja, but as a continuation of the same impulse: to care, to fix, to be there.</p>

            <h2>The End</h2>
            <p>Ove dies in his sleep, years later. The cat is on the bed. The house is full of the traces of his life—and of the people he let in. The novel closes with the neighborhood carrying on: Parvaneh, the cat, the community. Ove's legacy is not grand—it is the small, stubborn, loyal presence he became. We are never too old to be needed, and we are never too broken to find a reason to stay.</p>

                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Second chances don't require a dramatic change of personality. Ove stays grumpy. What changes is that he lets people need him—and he needs them back. That is enough.</p>
