        <h1 class="chapter-title">Rune & the Cat</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">A Man Called Ove</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Rune was Ove's neighbor and once his friend—until they fell out over cars (Saab vs. Volvo) and principles. Now Rune is ill and in a wheelchair; his wife Anita needs help. Ove doesn't want to get involved—but he does. A stray cat that Sonja would have loved adopts Ove. He complains about the cat—and feeds it. Both the past (Rune) and the present (the cat, the neighbors) are pulling Ove back into life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Rune</h2>
            <p>Rune and Ove used to have coffee and fix things together. Then they disagreed—and stopped speaking. Now Rune can't speak at all. Ove helps Anita with the bureaucracy that wants to take Rune away to a home. In helping his old enemy, Ove is also making peace with the past. Forgiveness and duty go hand in hand.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "We always think there's enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. Then something happens and then we've run out of time."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Cat</h2>
            <p>The cat is half-starved and stubborn. Ove doesn't want a cat—but Sonja would have taken it in. So Ove feeds it, lets it in, and complains the whole time. The cat becomes part of his routine and part of his heart. Small commitments—to a cat, to a neighbor—add up to a reason to stay.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Purpose doesn't have to be grand. It can be a cat, a neighbor's wife, a driving lesson. Ove finds his way back by doing the next small thing—and the next.</p>
