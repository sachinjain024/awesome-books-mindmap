            <h2>How Ove Became Ove</h2>
<p>The story fills in Ove's history: early loss, strict values from his father, hardship, meeting Sonja, and later caring for her through severe illness and disability.</p>
<p>When Sonja dies, Ove's life structure collapses. His desire to die is tied to loyalty, grief, and the absence of purpose.</p>
<div class="quote-box">
"Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the greatest motivations for living."
<div class="attribution">- Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove</div>
</div>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Present behavior is often legible through past loss.</li>
<li>Grief can look like anger or withdrawal.</li>
<li>New purpose does not erase old love; it coexists with it.</li>
</ul>
