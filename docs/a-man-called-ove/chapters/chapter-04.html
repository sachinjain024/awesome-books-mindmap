<p>Ove keeps helping: driving lessons, repairs, ladders, practical fixes. The neighborhood slowly starts treating him as indispensable.</p>

<div class="insight-box">
<h4>Key Insight</h4>

</div>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Purpose often comes through service.</li>
<li>Love can reshape identity over decades.</li>
