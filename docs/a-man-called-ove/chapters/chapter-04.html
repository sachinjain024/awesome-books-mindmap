        <div class="chapter-meta">A Man Called Ove</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Ove helps Parvaneh learn to drive (with much complaining), fixes a radiator for a young man, lends a ladder, and becomes the person the neighborhood relies on. Flashbacks show his youth: his father's death, the fire that destroyed his house, and the day he met Sonja on a train. She was the first person who really saw him—and the one who gave him a life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Being Useful</h2>
            <p>Ove's identity has always been tied to being useful—fixing things, following rules, doing his part. When he lost his job and his wife, he lost his sense of purpose. The neighbors give it back. They need his skills, his stubbornness, his presence. He grumbles—but he is needed. That need is a lifeline.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Ove had never been asked how he was doing. Not by Sonja. She'd always asked how he was doing in a different way. She'd asked: 'How's the car?' or 'How's the house?' or 'How's the job?' She'd never asked how he was. She'd known."

            <h2>Meeting Sonja</h2>
            <p>In flashback, Ove meets Sonja on a train. She is reading; he is silent. She talks to him. She is the first person who doesn't run from his bluntness—she laughs. She becomes his wife, his color, his reason. The novel shows that love gave Ove a life—and that after her death, the neighborhood can give him a reason to stay in it.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Sonja didn't ask "How are you?" in words—she asked through the things that mattered to him. The neighbors do something similar: they need him in concrete ways, and that need says "you matter."</p>
