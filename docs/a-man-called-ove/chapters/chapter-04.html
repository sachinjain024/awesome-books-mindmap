            <h2>Being Useful Again</h2>
<p>Ove keeps helping: driving lessons, repairs, ladders, practical fixes. The neighborhood slowly starts treating him as indispensable.</p>
<p>Flashbacks reveal Ove's early losses and his meeting with Sonja, who saw beyond his bluntness and gave his life warmth, meaning, and direction.</p>
<div class="insight-box">
<h4>Key Insight</h4>
<p>Usefulness is Ove's language of care. The neighborhood gives him back the role that grief and retirement took away.</p>
</div>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Purpose often comes through service.</li>
<li>Love can reshape identity over decades.</li>
<li>Community can restore what grief strips away.</li>
</ul>
