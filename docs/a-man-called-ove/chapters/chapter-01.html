            <h2>The Grumpy Man</h2>
<p>Ove is fifty-nine. He has strict rules about parking, trash, and the right way to do things. His wife Sonja has died, he has been forced to retire, and he no longer sees a reason to stay alive.</p>
<p>The novel first shows Ove's hard surface: stubborn, judgmental, and angry at a changing world. Beneath that surface is grief and a man who once loved deeply.</p>

"People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had."

<h4>Key Insight</h4>

<li>Rigidity can hide grief and a deep need for meaning.</li>
<li>Loss can make the future feel unnecessary.</li>
