        <div class="intro">
            <p>Parvaneh and Patrick move in next door with their two young daughters. They back a trailer over Ove's mailbox. They can't drive, can't fix things, and keep asking for help. Ove is furious—but he helps anyway. Parvaneh refuses to be shut out. She sees through his grumpiness and keeps showing up. Slowly, Ove is pulled back into the world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Parvaneh</h2>
            <p>Parvaneh is pregnant, stubborn, and kind. She doesn't take no for an answer. She asks Ove to teach her to drive, to help with the girls, to fix things. She also sees that he is sad—and she doesn't leave him alone. Her persistence is a form of love. Ove complains—but he shows up.</p>
