            <h2>Parvaneh Arrives</h2>
<p>Parvaneh and Patrick move in next door with their daughters and immediately disrupt Ove’s carefully ordered life. They need help constantly and refuse to be pushed away.</p>
<p>Parvaneh’s persistence is practical and emotional. She asks Ove for driving lessons, household help, and support. Ove complains, but he keeps showing up.</p>
<div class="insight-box">
<h4>Key Insight</h4>
