            <h2>Parvaneh Arrives</h2>
<p>Parvaneh and Patrick move in next door with their daughters and immediately disrupt Ove's carefully ordered life. They need help constantly and refuse to be pushed away.</p>
<p>Parvaneh's persistence is practical and emotional. She asks Ove for driving lessons, household help, and support. Ove complains, but he keeps showing up.</p>
<div class="insight-box">
<h4>Key Insight</h4>
<p>Being needed gives Ove a reason to get out of bed. Responsibility becomes a bridge back into life.</p>
</div>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Isolation weakens when others keep reaching out.</li>
<li>Helpfulness can reopen connection before words do.</li>

</ul>
