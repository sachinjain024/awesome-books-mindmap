            <h2>About This Book</h2>
<p><strong>A Man Called Ove</strong> follows a rigid, rule-bound widower who believes his life has ended with his wife's death. As new neighbors, old obligations, and small daily responsibilities keep interrupting his isolation, Ove is gradually pulled back into relationship and purpose.</p>
<p>This mind map traces Ove's emotional arc from grief and withdrawal to reluctant belonging. It highlights the novel's core ideas about usefulness, community, loss, and the possibility of second chances at any age.</p>

            <h3>Core Stoic Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Being needed gives life meaning; usefulness can restore will after loss.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Community:</strong> Small acts of help and neighborhood connection can save us when we withdraw.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Love and Grief:</strong> Harshness can mask deep love and unresolved grief.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Second Chances:</strong> It is never too late to let people in and build a new reason to stay.</li>
