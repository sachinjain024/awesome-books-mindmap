        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Four: The Players</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Money matters—not just as purchasing power, but as a signal. Compensation sends powerful messages about what the organization values. This chapter explores how to use compensation as a form of feedback that reinforces desired performance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Money as Message</h2>
            <p>Beyond enabling people to pay bills, compensation communicates:</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>What Compensation Signals</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>How the organization values your contribution</li>
                    <li>Where you stand relative to peers</li>
                    <li>What behaviors and results are rewarded</li>
                    <li>Your trajectory within the organization</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Money has a powerful significance that goes beyond its purchasing power: it's a measure of one's worth and achievement."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Comparison Problem</h2>
            <p>People inevitably compare their compensation to others. This creates challenges:</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Comparison Dynamics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>People compare to peers, not to market</li>
                    <li>Perceived unfairness is demotivating</li>
                    <li>Compression (everyone paid similarly) rewards mediocrity</li>
                    <li>Large gaps create resentment if not justified</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Performance-Based Pay</h2>
            <p>Grove advocates for compensation that reflects performance differences:</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Performance Differentiation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top performers should earn significantly more</li>
                    <li>Raises should vary meaningfully by performance level</li>
                    <li>Average raises for average performance—not inflation plus</li>
                    <li>Be willing to give small or no raises for below-average work</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="comparison-box">

                            <li>Below: 3%</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Signal: Performance doesn't really matter</p>

                    <div class="comparison-column high">

            <h2>Communicating Compensation</h2>
            <p>How you communicate compensation is as important as the number:</p>

            <div class="leverage-box">
                <h4>Effective Communication</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connect the number to specific performance</li>
                    <li>Explain how it compares to peers (generally, not specifically)</li>
                    <li>Link to future expectations</li>
                    <li>Be direct about what drives pay increases</li>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When Money Isn't Enough</h2>
            <p>Remember Maslow: once basic needs are met, money's motivational power diminishes. For self-actualized employees, other factors matter more:</p>

                <li>Compensation is a signal of value, not just purchasing power</li>
                <li>Differentiate pay meaningfully by performance—sameness rewards mediocrity</li>

                <li>Communicate compensation decisions clearly, linked to performance</li>
