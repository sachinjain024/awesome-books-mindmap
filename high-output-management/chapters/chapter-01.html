        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Basics of Production</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part One: The Breakfast Factory</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Andy Grove opens with an unconventional analogy: imagine you're running a breakfast factory that serves a three-minute boiled egg, toast, and coffee. Through this simple example, he introduces the fundamental concepts of production that apply to any organization—including knowledge work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Breakfast Factory</h2>
            <p>The goal is simple: deliver a complete breakfast with a three-minute egg, buttered toast, and coffee, all arriving at the same time and all hot. This deceptively simple challenge reveals the core principles of production management.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                <p>If you just start making everything at once, you'll get chaos: cold eggs, burnt toast, or long waits. The key insight is that different elements have different processing times, and you must work backward from the desired delivery time.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Limiting Step</h2>
            <p>Every production process has a <strong>limiting step</strong>—the step that takes the longest time. Everything else must be scheduled around this constraint.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Limiting Step Principle</h4>
                <p>In the breakfast example, the egg is the limiting step. It takes exactly 3 minutes to boil. You must start the egg first and schedule everything else to complete just as the egg is ready.</p>
                <p>In your work: <em>Identify your limiting step and build your entire operation around it.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The key principle is to plan the whole process around the longest, or most difficult, or most expensive step—the limiting step."

            <h2>Three Types of Production Operations</h2>
            <p>Grove identifies three fundamental types of operations that combine to form any production process:</p>

            <div class="process-box">
                <h4>The Three Operations</h4>
                <div class="meeting-grid">
                    <div class="meeting-type">
                        <h5>Process</h5>
                        <p>A physical or chemical change in the material (e.g., boiling the egg)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="meeting-type">
                        <h5>Assembly</h5>
                        <p>Putting components together (e.g., plating the breakfast)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="meeting-type">
                        <h5>Test</h5>
                        <p>Examining the quality (e.g., checking if the egg is done)</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Process Flow and Time Offsets</h2>
            <p>To deliver everything simultaneously, you must work backward from delivery time and start each step at the right moment. This is <strong>time offsetting</strong>.</p>

            <div class="process-box">
                <h4>Breakfast Factory Timeline</h4>
                <div class="process-steps">
                    <span class="process-step">Start Egg (T-3min)</span>
                    <span class="process-arrow">→</span>
                    <span class="process-step">Start Toast (T-2min)</span>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Adding Continuous Operation</h2>
            <p>When serving many customers, you can't handle them one at a time. You need <strong>continuous operation</strong>—a steady flow where new breakfasts enter production as others complete.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Batch vs. Continuous</h4>
                <p><strong>Batch operation:</strong> Make one complete breakfast, then start the next. Low efficiency, high waiting time.</p>
                <p><strong>Continuous operation:</strong> Stagger production so a new egg goes in as one comes out. Higher throughput, better utilization.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Application to Knowledge Work</h2>
            <p>While Grove uses manufacturing analogies, these principles apply directly to knowledge work:</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Knowledge Work Production</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Limiting step:</strong> What's the longest task in your process? (e.g., legal review, executive approval)</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong> The work that transforms inputs (e.g., writing, coding, analyzing)</li>
                    <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> Combining work products (e.g., compiling a report)</li>
                    <li><strong>Test:</strong> Quality checking (e.g., code review, editing)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify the limiting step and build your entire process around it</li>
                <li>Every process consists of process, assembly, and test operations</li>
                <li>Work backward from delivery time to schedule each step</li>
                <li>Move from batch to continuous operation for higher throughput</li>
                <li>These principles apply to knowledge work, not just manufacturing</li>
