            <h3>Core Principles of This Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feelings First:</strong> Accept and acknowledge feelings before trying to fix problems or change behavior</li>
                <li><strong>Respect Goes Both Ways:</strong> Children deserve the same respect we give adults</li>
                <li><strong>Describe, Don't Evaluate:</strong> Say what you see instead of judging with "good" or "bad"</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-Solve Together:</strong> Include children in finding solutions to conflicts</li>
                <li><strong>Autonomy Builds Confidence:</strong> Let children make choices and learn from experience</li>
                <li><strong>Words Matter:</strong> The way we talk to children becomes their inner voice</li>
                <li><strong>Connection Before Correction:</strong> Children cooperate when they feel understood</li>
                <li><strong>Progress, Not Perfection:</strong> Every positive interaction makes a difference</li>

            <h3>Quick Wins to Start Today</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Replace "Don't..." with "Let's..." or describing what needs to happen</li>
                <li>Instead of "Good job!" try "I see you..." (describe what they did)</li>
                <li>When a child is upset, resist the urge to fix it - just listen and name the feeling</li>
                <li>Give choices whenever possible: "Do you want to wear the red or blue shirt?"</li>
                <li>Use one word instead of lectures: "Teeth." "Homework." "Jacket."</li>
