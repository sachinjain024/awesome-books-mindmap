        <div class="chapter-meta">The Little Prince</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The little prince must return to his planet and his rose. The snake, who can send him back with one bite, offers to help. He says goodbye to the pilot and leaves him with the promise that when the pilot looks at the stars, he will hear the prince's laugh—because what matters is invisible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Returning Home</h2>
            <p>The prince has learned that his rose is unique because of the time he gave her. He must go back to care for her. The snake explains that his bite will free the prince from his heavy body so he can return to his asteroid. The prince accepts—not as death but as a way home.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "What matters is what is invisible... It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."

            <h2>The Pilot's Promise</h2>
            <p>The prince tells the pilot that when he looks at the night sky, he will think of the prince's laugh—and it will be as if all the stars are laughing. The stars become a gift: a way to remember that what we love is still with us in the invisible. The pilot is left in the desert with the drawing of the prince and the box with the sheep—and the responsibility to remember.</p>

                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Goodbye is not the end of the bond. The prince lives on in the pilot's memory and in the stars. What we have tamed and loved remains in what is invisible—in the heart.</p>
