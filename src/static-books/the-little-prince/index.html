            <h2>About This Mind Map</h2>
            <p>A pilot stranded in the desert meets a little prince who has traveled from a tiny asteroid. Through their conversations, Saint-Exupéry explores what truly matters: seeing with the heart, taming and being responsible for those we love, and the meaning we give to the people and things in our lives.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>See with the heart</strong> — What is essential is invisible to the eye.</li>
                    <li><strong>You are responsible for what you tame</strong> — Love creates obligation and meaning.</li>
                    <li><strong>It is the time you gave that makes your rose unique</strong> — Relationships gain value through care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grown-ups forget</strong> — Numbers and explanations can replace wonder; we must not forget to see.</li>
