            <h2>About This Mind Map</h2>
            <p>Santiago is an aging Cuban fisherman who has gone eighty-four days without a catch. He sets out alone into the Gulf Stream, hooks a giant marlin, and fights for days to bring it in—only to lose it to sharks. Hemingway's novella is a meditation on perseverance, respect for the adversary, and dignity in defeat.</p>
