        <div class="intro">
            <p>Santiago lashes the marlin to the boat and turns for home. The blood in the water draws sharks. He fights them with the harpoon, then the knife, then the oar—but they keep coming. They take the fish. He has nothing left to bring home but the skeleton.</p>

            <h2>Fighting the Sharks</h2>
            <p>The first shark is a mako—fast and strong. Santiago kills it with the harpoon but loses the weapon. More sharks come. He fights with the knife until the blade breaks, then with the oar. He knows he cannot win—but he fights anyway. "A man can be destroyed but not defeated."</p>

            <h2>Accepting the Loss</h2>
            <p>By the time he reaches the harbor, the marlin is only a skeleton. The other fishermen measure it—eighteen feet. Santiago has lost the meat, the money, the proof. But he has not lost himself. He did what he set out to do: he went far out, he found the great fish, he fought with everything he had. The sharks took the prize—but they did not take his dignity.</p>

                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Defeat is when you stop trying or when you betray who you are. Destruction is when the world takes everything from you. You can be destroyed—and still not defeated.</p>
