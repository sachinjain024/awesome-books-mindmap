        <div class="chapter-meta">Part V: Geographical Distribution</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Darwin continues his exploration of biogeography, now examining freshwater species, oceanic islands, and the remarkable effects of glacial periods. Each pattern he explores reinforces the same conclusion: species distributions are explained by history—by descent, dispersal, and modification—not by independent creation suited to each environment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Freshwater Species</h2>
            <p>Freshwater habitats present an interesting puzzle: lakes and rivers are isolated from each other, yet freshwater species are often widely distributed.</p>

            <div class="observation-box">
                <h4>The Freshwater Paradox</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lakes and rivers are separated by land—barriers for aquatic organisms</li>
                    <li>Yet many freshwater fish, plants, and invertebrates have wide distributions</li>
                    <li>The same species may occur in disconnected watersheds</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>How do freshwater species disperse across land?</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Mechanisms of Freshwater Dispersal</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flooding:</strong> Rivers occasionally connect during floods</li>
                    <li><strong>Birds:</strong> Wading birds carry eggs, small organisms, and seeds on feet and feathers</li>
                    <li><strong>Wind:</strong> Dried ponds leave eggs and seeds that can be blown to new waters</li>
                    <li><strong>Past connections:</strong> Watersheds that are now separate were once connected</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Darwin conducted experiments showing that snail eggs, fish eggs, and aquatic plant seeds could survive being dried and later transported.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Oceanic Islands: Further Evidence</h2>
            <p>Darwin elaborates on oceanic islands, which provide crucial evidence for evolution:</p>

            <div class="observation-box">
                <h4>What Oceanic Islands Lack</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No native land mammals</strong> (except bats, which can fly)</li>
                    <li><strong>No amphibians</strong> (cannot tolerate salt water)</li>
                    <li><strong>Often no indigenous freshwater fish</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are exactly the groups that cannot disperse across oceans. Their absence confirms that island species arrived by dispersal, not by creation in place.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="observation-box">
                <h4>What Oceanic Islands Have</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Birds:</strong> Can fly to islands</li>
                    <li><strong>Insects:</strong> Can be blown by storms</li>
                    <li><strong>Plants:</strong> Seeds can float or be carried by birds</li>
                    <li><strong>Reptiles:</strong> Some can survive salt water or rafting</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Endemic Species on Islands</h2>
            <p>Islands are famous for unique species found nowhere else:</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <h4>Endemic Species</h4>
                <p>Species found only in one location. Oceanic islands often have high proportions of endemic species because their isolation allows colonizers to evolve in new directions without competition from continental relatives.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="argument-box">
                <h4>Why Islands Have Endemics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Colonizers arrive and find empty niches</li>
                    <li>Isolation prevents gene flow with mainland populations</li>
                    <li>New selective pressures favor novel adaptations</li>
                    <li>Over time, island populations diverge into distinct species</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>This explains both the uniqueness of island species and their similarity to mainland forms—they're modified descendants of mainland colonizers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Effects of Glacial Periods</h2>
            <p>Darwin discusses how ice ages dramatically affected species distributions:</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Glacial Migration</h4>
                <p>During ice ages, arctic species spread southward as temperatures dropped. When glaciers retreated, some populations became isolated on mountaintops—"islands" of cold habitat in a warming world. This explains why similar alpine species occur on disconnected mountain ranges.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Alpine Species Distribution</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Same or similar species occur on Alps, Pyrenees, and Scandinavian mountains</li>
                    <li>Similar arctic and alpine floras across northern continents</li>
                    <li>Mountain peaks harbor relict populations from glacial times</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>This once-puzzling pattern makes perfect sense when viewed historically: species that were once continuous became fragmented as climates changed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Analogies Between Isolated Regions</h2>
            <p>Darwin notes that isolated regions often show similar patterns of unique forms:</p>

            <div class="observation-box">
                <h4>Parallel Patterns</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Australia has many endemic species and genera</li>
                    <li>Madagascar has unique fauna resembling African ancestors but distinct</li>
                    <li>New Zealand has ancient lineages found nowhere else</li>
                    <li>Each isolated landmass is a natural experiment in independent evolution</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Summary: Geography Supports Evolution</h2>
            <p>Darwin synthesizes the biogeographic evidence:</p>

            <div class="argument-box">
                <h4>The Case from Geography</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distributions are explained by barriers and dispersal, not by suitable environments</li>
                    <li>Species in each region are related regardless of habitat</li>
                    <li>Island species resemble nearby mainland forms</li>
                    <li>Islands lack groups that cannot disperse across oceans</li>
                    <li>Endemic species result from isolation and divergence</li>
                    <li>Past climate changes explain current distributions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every one of these patterns follows from evolution and common descent. None is explained by—or even expected from—independent creation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the same areas, is at once explained."
