        <div class="chapter-meta">Part VI: Classification & Conclusion</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Darwin now draws together multiple lines of evidence—classification, morphology, embryology, and rudimentary organs—showing that each makes sense under evolution and is inexplicable under special creation. The "natural system" of classification isn't arbitrary; it reflects real genealogical relationships. All organisms form a single Tree of Life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Classification Reflects Genealogy</h2>
            <p>Naturalists arrange organisms into a hierarchical system: species within genera, genera within families, families within orders, and so on. But what does this hierarchy mean?</p>

            <div class="argument-box">
                <h4>The Genealogical Explanation</h4>
                <p>The nested hierarchy of classification reflects patterns of descent:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Species in a genus</strong> share a recent common ancestor</li>
                    <li><strong>Genera in a family</strong> share a more distant ancestor</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher categories</strong> reflect increasingly ancient relationships</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Classification isn't arbitrary—it captures real genealogical connections.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "All true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Homology: Similar Structures, Different Functions</h2>
            <p>Darwin explores one of the most striking patterns in comparative anatomy: homologous structures.</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <h4>Homology</h4>
                <p>Structural similarity due to shared ancestry, regardless of function. The same bones appear in the human hand, the bat's wing, the whale's flipper, and the mole's digging paw—arranged differently, sized differently, used differently, but fundamentally the same bones.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>The Vertebrate Forelimb</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Human arm:</strong> Grasping and manipulation</li>
                    <li><strong>Bird wing:</strong> Flight</li>
                    <li><strong>Whale flipper:</strong> Swimming</li>
                    <li><strong>Horse leg:</strong> Running</li>
                    <li><strong>Mole paw:</strong> Digging</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All have the same bones: humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals, phalanges. The same pattern, endlessly modified.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Why Homology Supports Evolution</h4>
                <p>If each species were created independently for its way of life, why use the same bones for swimming, flying, running, and digging? A designer starting fresh might use entirely different structures. But descent with modification explains it: the common pattern was inherited from a common ancestor, then modified for different functions.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Unity of Type</h2>
            <p>All vertebrates share the same basic body plan, despite enormous differences in form and function:</p>

            <div class="observation-box">
                <h4>The Vertebrate Pattern</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Internal skeleton with vertebral column</li>
                    <li>Skull protecting the brain</li>
                    <li>Four limbs (or vestiges thereof)</li>
                    <li>Same organ systems: heart, liver, kidneys</li>
                    <li>Same basic nervous system organization</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Fish, frogs, lizards, birds, and mammals are variations on a theme—the same theme, inherited from a common ancestor.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Embryology</h2>
            <p>Darwin considers embryological evidence among the strongest for evolution:</p>

            <div class="observation-box">
                <h4>Embryonic Similarity</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Embryos of different species resemble each other more than adults do</li>
                    <li>Fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, and mammal embryos are nearly indistinguishable at early stages</li>
                    <li>Structures appearing in embryos may disappear or transform in adults</li>
                    <li>Human embryos have gill slits, tails, and other "fish-like" features</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="argument-box">
                <h4>Why Embryos Are Similar</h4>
                <p>Embryonic stages are conservative—they change more slowly than adult stages. Selection primarily acts on adults (which must survive and reproduce), while embryos are protected. Therefore, embryos retain ancestral features longer. The human embryo's gill slits are not preparation for breathing water; they're an inheritance from fish ancestors, modified in development to form different structures.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form of each great class of animals."
                <div class="attribution">— Charles Darwin</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Rudimentary Organs</h2>
            <p>Perhaps no evidence is more puzzling under creation, or more expected under evolution, than rudimentary (vestigial) organs:</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <h4>Rudimentary Organs</h4>
                <p>Structures that are reduced or have lost their original function. They make no sense as new creations but make perfect sense as inherited from ancestors in which they were functional.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Examples of Rudimentary Organs</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Whale hip bones:</strong> Tiny, buried in muscle, serving no function in swimming</li>
                    <li><strong>Flightless bird wings:</strong> Too small for flight (ostriches, kiwis)</li>
                    <li><strong>Cave fish eyes:</strong> Degenerate, covered by skin, non-functional</li>
                    <li><strong>Human appendix:</strong> Reduced remnant of a larger cecum</li>
                    <li><strong>Leg bones in some snakes:</strong> Tiny vestiges hidden under scales</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Why Rudiments Exist</h4>
                <p>Under creation, why give whales useless hip bones or cave fish useless eyes? Under evolution, these are simply organs that were once useful to ancestors but, after conditions changed, became dispensable. Selection no longer maintains them, so they gradually degenerate. They're historical relics—evidence of ancestry.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Tree of Life</h2>
            <p>Darwin's famous metaphor captures the unity of all life:</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth... The green and budding twigs may represent existing species... As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications."
                <div class="attribution">— Charles Darwin</div>
            </div>

            <p>This single image—all life connected through branching descent from common ancestors—unifies all the evidence Darwin has presented.</p>
