        <div class="chapter-meta">Practice Five - Part 1</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Effective executives make effective decisions. This chapter introduces the systematic approach to decision-making. Drucker emphasizes that effective decisions are based on principles and the dissent of opinions—not on consensus or expedience.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Strategic vs. Tactical Decisions</h2>
            <p>Effective executives distinguish between decisions that matter and those that don't. They focus their decision-making energy on a few important strategic decisions.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Types of Decisions</h4>
                <p><strong>Strategic (Generic):</strong> Decisions based on principle that apply broadly</p>
                <p><strong>Tactical (Unique):</strong> Decisions specific to particular situations</p>
                <p>Most problems are generic—they've happened before and will happen again. Treat them as such.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "A decision is a judgment. It is a choice between alternatives. It is rarely a choice between right and wrong. It is at best a choice between 'almost right' and 'probably wrong.'"
                <div class="attribution">— Peter Drucker</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Five Elements of Decision-Making</h2>
            <p>Drucker identifies five essential elements in the decision process:</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Element 1: Classify the Problem</h4>
                <p>Is this generic or unique? Most problems are generic—recurring situations that require a principle or policy. Only truly exceptional events require unique solutions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Element 2: Define the Specifications</h4>
                <p>What does the decision need to accomplish? What are the objectives, the minimum goals, and the conditions that must be satisfied? Be clear about what "success" looks like.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Element 3: Start with the Right Thing</h4>
                <p>Start with what is right, not what is acceptable. Compromise may be necessary later, but start with the ideal solution. Otherwise, you compromise on the compromise.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Element 4: Build in Action</h4>
                <p>Converting the decision into action is a separate step. Who will carry it out? What do they need to know? What must change? Build action into the decision from the start.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Element 5: Build in Feedback</h4>
                <p>How will you know if the decision is working? Build in systematic feedback mechanisms. Test assumptions against reality. Go and see for yourself.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Danger of Plausible Assumptions</h2>
            <p>Decisions always rest on assumptions about the future. The danger lies in assumptions that seem plausible but are untested.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Testing Assumptions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>What does this decision assume about the future?</li>
                    <li>How can we test these assumptions?</li>
                    <li>What would tell us we're wrong?</li>
                    <li>How will we know when to revisit this decision?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Boundary Conditions</h2>
            <p>Every decision has <strong>boundary conditions</strong>—the specifications it must satisfy. A decision that fails to meet its boundary conditions is worse than no decision.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Setting Boundaries</h4>
                <p>What are the minimum objectives? What must this decision accomplish? What are the time limits? The resource constraints? The risks we cannot accept?</p>
                <p>Clarity about boundaries prevents later disappointment.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Generic vs. Unique Problems</h2>

            <div class="comparison-box">
                <h4>Problem Classification</h4>
                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div class="comparison-column effective">
                        <h5>Generic Problems</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recurring situations</li>
                            <li>Require a rule/policy</li>
                            <li>Solve once, apply many times</li>
                            <li>Example: Inventory management</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column ineffective">
                        <h5>Unique Problems</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Truly exceptional events</li>
                            <li>Require specific solutions</li>
                            <li>Cannot generalize</li>
                            <li>Example: Merger decision</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The common error: treating a generic problem as if it were unique, requiring constant firefighting. Or treating a unique event as generic, applying an inappropriate rule.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Classify problems: generic (need a principle) or unique (need specific solution)</li>
                <li>Define specifications: what must the decision accomplish?</li>
                <li>Start with what's right, not what's acceptable</li>
                <li>Build action into the decision: who does what by when</li>
                <li>Build in feedback: how will you know if it's working?</li>
                <li>Test your assumptions—don't accept plausibility</li>
