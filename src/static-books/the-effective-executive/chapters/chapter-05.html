        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5: First Things First</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Practice Four</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Effective executives concentrate. They do first things first—and second things not at all. The secret is not doing more things, but doing fewer things better. This requires courage: the courage to set priorities and, more importantly, the courage to set posterities—things that will not be done.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Secret of Effectiveness</h2>
            <p>If there is any one "secret" to effectiveness, it is concentration. Effective executives do one thing at a time.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "If there is any one 'secret' of effectiveness, it is concentration. Effective executives do first things first and they do one thing at a time."
                <div class="attribution">— Peter Drucker</div>
            </div>

            <p>This seems simple. It is anything but. The pressures to do many things at once—to react to every urgency—are enormous. Concentration requires saying no.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Priorities and Posterities</h2>
            <p>Setting priorities is important. But even more important—and more difficult—is setting <strong>posterities</strong>: deciding what NOT to do.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Priorities vs. Posterities</h4>
                <p><strong>Priorities:</strong> Things that must be done first</p>
                <p><strong>Posterities:</strong> Things that will not be done at all (at least not now)</p>
                <p>There are always more worthy tasks than time to do them. The effective executive chooses—and abandons.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Pressure of Yesterday</h4>
                <p>Yesterday's successes create today's obligations. Programs started years ago demand continuation. The courage to abandon yesterday is essential. Without it, you have no resources for tomorrow.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Rules for Concentration</h2>
            <p>Drucker offers several rules for maintaining concentration:</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Drucker's Concentration Rules</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Slough off the past:</strong> Regularly ask "If we weren't already doing this, would we start now?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on opportunity:</strong> Put best people on opportunities, not problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Make your own priorities:</strong> Don't let pressures make them for you</li>
                    <li><strong>Do one thing at a time:</strong> Sequential focus beats simultaneous fragmentation</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Courage to Abandon</h2>
            <p>Abandoning yesterday's success is one of the hardest things in management. But it's essential.</p>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>The Abandonment Question</h4>
                <p>"If we were not already committed to this, would we go into it now?"</p>
                <p>If the answer is "no," the next question is: "How do we get out?"</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Principles for Setting Priorities</h2>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Priority-Setting Principles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pick the future over the past:</strong> Opportunities, not problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on opportunity, not problem:</strong> Problems only restore normalcy</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose your own direction:</strong> Don't follow the crowd</li>
                    <li><strong>Aim high:</strong> Something that will make a difference if successful</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The job is not to set priorities. That is easy. Everybody can do that. The real job is to set posteriorities—that is, to decide what tasks not to tackle—and to stick to that decision."

                <li>Setting posterities (what NOT to do) matters more than setting priorities</li>
                <li>Regularly abandon yesterday: "Would we start this if we weren't doing it?"</li>
                <li>Focus on opportunities, not problems</li>
