        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 7: Effective Decisions</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Practice Five - Part 2</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>This chapter reveals Drucker's most controversial insight about decision-making: effective decisions start with opinions, not facts. You need dissent, not consensus. And you must know when not to make a decision at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Start with Opinions, Not Facts</h2>
            <p>Drucker's counterintuitive principle: a decision should start with opinions. Why? Because there are no facts until someone has decided what is relevant.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "People do not start out with the search for facts. They start out with an opinion. There is nothing wrong with this. People experienced in an area should have an opinion."
                <div class="attribution">— Peter Drucker</div>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>The Function of Opinions</h4>
                <p>An opinion is an untested hypothesis. It's valuable because it guides the search for facts. The question is: "What do we need to know to test this opinion?"</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Need for Dissent</h2>
            <p>Effective executives cultivate dissent and disagreement. Decisions without alternatives considered are dangerous.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Why Dissent Matters</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prevents being a prisoner of the organization:</strong> Only dissent can reveal what you're not being told</li>
                    <li><strong>Stimulates imagination:</strong> Alternatives spark creative thinking</li>
                    <li><strong>Tests assumptions:</strong> Conflicting views expose hidden assumptions</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Unless one has considered alternatives, one has a closed mind. This, above all, explains why effective decision-makers deliberately disregard the second rule in the old textbook and create dissent and disagreement."
                <div class="attribution">— Peter Drucker</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Danger of Consensus</h2>
            <p>A decision reached through consensus—where everyone agrees from the start—is suspect. It likely means no real thinking has occurred.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Signs of Premature Consensus</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quick agreement on complex issues</li>
                    <li>No alternatives considered</li>
                    <li>No one challenges assumptions</li>
                    <li>The "plausible" is accepted without testing</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Forcing Dissent</h4>
                <p>When faced with quick agreement, effective executives force dissent:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"What are we missing?"</li>
                    <li>"What would someone arguing against this say?"</li>
                    <li>"Why might this be wrong?"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Alfred Sloan's Example</h2>
            <p>Drucker recounts a famous story of Alfred Sloan at General Motors:</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Sloan's Meeting</h4>
                <p>At a senior committee meeting, Sloan said: "Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete agreement on the decision here."</p>
                <p>Everyone nodded.</p>
                <p>"Then," Sloan continued, "I propose we postpone further discussion until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When Not to Decide</h2>
            <p>Sometimes the right decision is no decision. Effective executives know when to act and when to wait.</p>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>Four Reasons Not to Decide</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>When action would do more harm than good:</strong> Sometimes the cost of action exceeds the cost of inaction</li>
                    <li><strong>When the situation may resolve itself:</strong> Some problems cure themselves</li>
                    <li><strong>When you lack adequate understanding:</strong> Wait until you know enough</li>
                    <li><strong>When it's not your decision:</strong> Don't decide what should be decided elsewhere</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "There are few things as useless—if not as harmful—as the right answer to the wrong question."
                <div class="attribution">— Peter Drucker</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Decision Process Summary</h2>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Drucker's Decision Checklist</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with opinions, not "facts"</li>
                    <li>Ask: "What do we need to know to test this opinion?"</li>
                    <li>Encourage dissent and alternatives</li>
                    <li>If there's quick consensus, postpone—develop disagreement first</li>
                    <li>Test assumptions by going to the source</li>
                    <li>Decide only when you must—some decisions aren't worth making</li>
                    <li>Build action and feedback into the decision</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with opinions (hypotheses), then search for facts to test them</li>
                <li>Cultivate dissent—consensus is often a sign of lazy thinking</li>
                <li>Consider alternatives before deciding</li>
                <li>Know when not to make a decision</li>
                <li>Go to the source to test your understanding</li>
                <li>If everyone agrees quickly, postpone—develop disagreement first</li>
