        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: Effectiveness Can Be Learned</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Introduction</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Drucker opens with a bold claim: effectiveness is a discipline that can be learned. Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are important—but without effectiveness, they remain potential rather than achievement. This chapter establishes why effectiveness matters and introduces the five practices that make executives effective.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Is an Executive?</h2>
            <p>Drucker defines an "executive" broadly—not by title or status, but by responsibility for decisions that affect the performance of the whole organization.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>The Knowledge Worker as Executive</h4>
                <p>Every knowledge worker in a modern organization is an "executive" if they make decisions that contribute to performance. The manager, the engineer, the researcher—all must think about their contribution and take responsibility for results.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Executives are not paid for doing things they like to do. They are paid for getting the right things done."
                <div class="attribution">— Peter Drucker</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Effectiveness Is Not Automatic</h2>
            <p>Intelligence and knowledge don't guarantee effectiveness. The world is full of brilliant people who accomplish nothing. Why?</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Realities Executives Face</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time belongs to everyone else:</strong> Executives are constantly interrupted and pulled in different directions</li>
                    <li><strong>Operating reality dominates:</strong> Day-to-day pressures crowd out important work</li>
                    <li><strong>Working within organizations:</strong> Your effectiveness depends on others using your contribution</li>
                    <li><strong>Inside focus:</strong> Organizations naturally focus inward; real results are outside</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Effectiveness Can Be Learned</h2>
            <p>The good news: effectiveness is not a gift. It's a discipline—a set of practices that can be learned like any other discipline.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Drucker's Central Insight</h4>
                <p>Effective executives differ widely in temperament, abilities, and interests. What they have in common are the practices they follow. Effectiveness is a habit—a complex of practices.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Five Practices</h2>
            <p>Drucker identifies five practices that characterize effective executives:</p>
