        <div class="chapter-meta">The Prophet</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Almustafa speaks on freedom—true freedom is the acceptance of what is necessary—and on reason and passion as the rudder and sails of the soul. Both are needed for the voyage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>On Freedom</h2>
            <p>At the city gate the guard asks how he may be free. The Prophet says: at the city gate you are already free. Freedom is not escape from bonds but the acceptance of necessity with clarity. "And you shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief, but rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound."</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction."
                <div class="attribution">— Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>On Reason and Passion</h2>
            <p>Your soul is often a battlefield between reason and passion. Let both be your guides: reason as the rudder, passion as the sails. Without the rudder the ship is lost; without the sails it does not move. "Let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion, that it may sing; and let it direct your passion with reason, that your passion may live through its own daily resurrection."</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Freedom is rising above necessity while accepting it—not running from it.</li>
                <li>Reason and passion together guide the soul; neither alone is enough.</li>
                <li>Let reason give passion direction; let passion give reason life.</li>
            </ul>
