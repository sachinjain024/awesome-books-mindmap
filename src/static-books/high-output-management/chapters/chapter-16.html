        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Four: The Players</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Grove concludes with what he considers the highest-leverage activity a manager can perform: training. Not training delegated to HR or outside vendors, but training done by the manager personally. This chapter makes the case for why training can't be abdicated—and how to do it well.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Leverage Argument</h2>
            <p>Consider the math:</p>

            <div class="equation-box">
                <h4>Training Leverage Calculation</h4>
                <div class="equation">
                    If you train 10 people for 4 hours each<br>
                    + 12 hours of preparation<br>
                    = 52 hours of your time
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">If training improves their performance by just 1% over the next year...</p>
                <div class="equation" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    10 people × 2,000 hours/year × 1% improvement<br>
                    = 200 hours of additional output
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #64748b;">Your 52-hour investment yields 200 hours of improved output. That's nearly 4x leverage.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Training Can't Be Delegated</h2>
            <p>Grove argues against outsourcing training to HR or external consultants:</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Why You Must Train</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>You know the work:</strong> You understand what good performance looks like</li>
                    <li><strong>You set standards:</strong> Training is where standards are established</li>
                    <li><strong>You have context:</strong> You can connect training to real situations</li>
                    <li><strong>You signal importance:</strong> If the boss doesn't train, it must not matter</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Training is, simply put, one of the highest-leverage activities a manager can perform. Consider for a moment the possibility of your putting on a series of four lectures for members of your department. Let's assume that you have ten students in your class."

            <div class="leverage-box">
                <h4>Grove's Training Method</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prepare thoroughly:</strong> Know your material deeply—this takes significant time</li>
                    <li><strong>Use real examples:</strong> Draw from your organization's actual experience</li>
                    <li><strong>Make it interactive:</strong> Lecture less, discuss more</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow up:</strong> Check that training translated to behavior change</li>
                    <li><strong>Iterate:</strong> Improve your training based on results</li>

            <h2>When to Train</h2>
            <p>Training opportunities arise constantly:</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Training Moments</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>New employee onboarding</li>
                    <li>New process or tool introduction</li>
                    <li>After a failure or mistake (what can we learn?)</li>
                    <li>When TRM needs to grow</li>
                    <li>Preparing for new responsibilities</li>
                    <li>Regular skills development</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Training Compound Effect</h2>
            <p>Training compounds over time. A trained employee trains others. Standards spread. The initial investment pays dividends for years.</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Intel's Training Culture</h4>
                <p>At Intel, managers at all levels were expected to teach. Grove himself taught courses on management and strategy. This created a culture where teaching was normal—not something relegated to a training department.</p>

            <h2>Starting Your Training Program</h2>

                    <li>Identify the most critical skills your team needs</li>
                    <li>Design a short course (start with 1-2 hours)</li>
                    <li>Prepare more than you think necessary</li>
                    <li>Deliver, get feedback, improve</li>

                <li>Training is one of the highest-leverage activities available to managers</li>
