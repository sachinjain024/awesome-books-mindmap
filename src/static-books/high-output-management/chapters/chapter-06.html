        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 6: Planning—Today's Actions for Tomorrow's Output</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Two: Management Is a Team Game</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Planning is how managers shape tomorrow's output through today's actions. Grove applies his production mindset to planning, treating it as a process with inputs, outputs, and measurable results. The goal isn't a perfect plan—it's better decisions and actions today.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Planning as Production</h2>
            <p>Like any production process, planning has a clear structure:</p>

            <div class="process-box">
                <h4>The Planning Process</h4>
                <div class="process-steps">
                    <span class="process-step">Assess Environment</span>
                    <span class="process-arrow">→</span>
                    <span class="process-step">Set Objectives</span>
                    <span class="process-arrow">→</span>
                    <span class="process-step">Define Actions</span>
                    <span class="process-arrow">→</span>
                    <span class="process-step">Execute & Monitor</span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Purpose of Planning</h2>
            <p>Planning isn't about predicting the future—it's about improving decisions today.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The output of the planning process is not the plan but the decisions made and the actions taken as a result of the process."
                <div class="attribution">— Andy Grove</div>
            </div>

            <p>A beautiful document that sits on a shelf is worthless. The value is in the thinking and the actions that emerge from it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Environmental Assessment</h2>
            <p>Planning starts with understanding the world you operate in. What's happening? What's changing?</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Assessment Questions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>What's happening with customers and their needs?</li>
                    <li>What are competitors doing?</li>
                    <li>What technological changes are coming?</li>
                    <li>What internal capabilities do we have?</li>
                    <li>What constraints are we operating under?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Management by Objectives (MBO)</h2>
            <p>Grove advocates for MBO—a system where objectives cascade down through the organization, with each level's objectives supporting the level above.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>MBO Principles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objectives:</strong> Where do I want to go? (Qualitative)</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Results:</strong> How do I know I'm getting there? (Quantitative)</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> My objectives support my manager's objectives</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited number:</strong> Focus on 3-5 objectives maximum</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Example OKR Structure</h4>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Improve product quality</p>
                <p><strong>Key Results:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce customer-reported bugs by 50%</li>
                    <li>Achieve 99.9% uptime</li>
                    <li>Decrease time-to-fix for critical issues to under 4 hours</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Planning Gap</h2>
            <p>There's always a gap between where you are today and where your objectives say you should be. This gap defines the work to be done.</p>

            <div class="equation-box">
                <h4>The Gap Equation</h4>
                <div class="equation">
                    Gap = Desired State - Current State
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #64748b;">Your actions must close this gap by the target date</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Actions: Closing the Gap</h2>
            <p>The gap tells you what to do, but you must convert that into specific actions:</p>

            <div class="leverage-box">
                <h4>Action Planning Checklist</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>What specific actions will close the gap?</li>
                    <li>What resources are needed?</li>
                    <li>What's the timeline?</li>
                    <li>Who is responsible for each action?</li>
                    <li>How will we know we're on track?</li>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Common Planning Failures</h2>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Why Plans Fail</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Too many objectives:</strong> Diluted focus produces mediocre results</li>
                    <li><strong>No key results:</strong> No way to measure progress</li>
                    <li><strong>Disconnected objectives:</strong> Individual OKRs don't support organization goals</li>
                    <li><strong>Set and forget:</strong> Plans created but never reviewed</li>
                    <li><strong>Perfectionism:</strong> Endless planning, no action</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Planning Cadence</h2>
            <p>Planning isn't a one-time event. It's a rhythm:</p>

            <div class="meeting-grid">
                <div class="meeting-type">
                    <h5>Annual Planning</h5>
                    <p>Set direction and major priorities for the year</p>

                <div class="meeting-type">
                    <h5>Quarterly Review</h5>
                    <p>Assess progress, adjust plans based on reality</p>

                <div class="meeting-type">
                    <h5>Monthly/Weekly</h5>
                    <p>Track key results, identify blockers</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The output of planning is not the plan—it's the decisions and actions taken</li>
                <li>MBO connects individual objectives to organizational goals through cascading alignment</li>
                <li>Objectives are qualitative (where), key results are quantitative (how to measure)</li>
                <li>Focus on 3-5 objectives maximum to maintain impact</li>
                <li>The "gap" between desired and current state defines the work</li>
                <li>Planning is a continuous cadence, not a one-time event</li>
