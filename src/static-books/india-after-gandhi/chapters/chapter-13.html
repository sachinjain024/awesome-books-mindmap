        <div class="chapter-meta">Part II: Nehru's India (1950-1964)</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The 1962 Sino-Indian War was a devastating blow to India's self-image and to Nehru personally. In a brief, humiliating conflict, China inflicted a crushing defeat on the Indian army. This chapter examines the war, its causes, and its profound consequences for Indian politics and foreign policy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Road to War</h2>
            <p>By 1962, Sino-Indian relations had deteriorated sharply. The Forward Policy—establishing Indian posts in disputed territory—provoked China. Neither side was willing to compromise on border claims they considered vital.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>The Fatal Miscalculation</h4>
                <p>Nehru and his advisors believed China would not attack. They assumed the international situation—China isolated after the Great Leap Forward famine—made war impossible. They were catastrophically wrong.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Chinese Attack</h2>
            <p>On October 20, 1962, China launched a massive attack on two fronts: in the northeast (NEFA) and in Ladakh. The Indian forces, poorly equipped, badly led, and spread thin, were overwhelmed.</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>Military Disaster</h4>
                <p>Indian troops, equipped for counter-insurgency rather than conventional war, faced Chinese forces seasoned by the Korean War. Many Indian soldiers had no winter clothing. Some units had only 20 rounds of ammunition per man. The collapse was swift and total.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Humiliation</h2>
            <p>The defeat was total. India lost over 3,000 soldiers killed or captured. The myth of "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai" was shattered. Nehru was forced to appeal for American military assistance—a blow to non-alignment.</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "My heart is full of sorrow at the reverses that our forces have suffered... We were getting out of touch with reality in the modern world and we were living in an atmosphere of our own creation."
                <cite>— Jawaharlal Nehru, addressing Parliament</cite>
            </div>

            <p>In the northeast, Chinese forces advanced virtually unopposed. Tezpur was evacuated; there was panic in Assam. The Chinese could have taken Assam—but they stopped and withdrew.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Did China Withdraw?</h2>
            <p>China's objectives remain debated. Having demonstrated military superiority and secured Aksai Chin, China withdrew from NEFA, returning to positions behind the McMahon Line. Possible reasons:</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>Chinese Calculations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logistics: Maintaining forces in NEFA through winter would be difficult</li>
                    <li>International pressure: The US and USSR supported India</li>
                    <li>Limited objectives: China wanted to teach India a "lesson," not conquer territory</li>
                    <li>Diplomatic position: Withdrawal strengthened China's claim to reasonableness</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Impact on Nehru</h2>
            <p>The defeat aged Nehru visibly. He never recovered his confidence. In Parliament, he faced harsh criticism from his own party. A no-confidence motion—unthinkable before—received significant support.</p>

            <div class="key-figure">
                <h4>A Broken Man</h4>
                <p>Nehru's health declined rapidly after the war. He suffered a stroke in January 1964 and died in May. Many believe the shock of the defeat hastened his death. The architect of independent India left the stage under the shadow of his greatest failure.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Consequences</h2>
            <p>The 1962 war transformed India. Defense spending increased dramatically. The army was modernized and expanded. Non-alignment was quietly modified to accept military assistance. Relations with China remained frozen for decades.</p>

            <div class="milestone-box">
                <h4>Lasting Changes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Defense budget doubled; military modernization accelerated</li>
                    <li>Non-alignment modified; India accepted Western military aid</li>
                    <li>China policy hardened; distrust became permanent</li>
                    <li>Pakistan saw opportunity; 1965 war followed</li>
                    <li>Public faith in government shaken; Nehru era ending</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Lessons</h2>
            <p>The 1962 war revealed multiple failures: intelligence failure (not knowing China was preparing attack), military failure (poorly equipped and led forces), and political failure (miscalculating Chinese intentions). India learned painful lessons about the gap between rhetoric and reality.</p>
