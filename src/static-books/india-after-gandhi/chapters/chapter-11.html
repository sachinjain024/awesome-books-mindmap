        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 11: The Law and the Prophets</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part II: Nehru's India (1950-1964)</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>India embarked on one of the most ambitious social reform projects in history—using law to transform deeply entrenched customs around marriage, inheritance, caste, and gender. This chapter examines the Hindu Code Bills and the tensions between reformers and traditionalists.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Hindu Code Bills</h2>
            <p>The Hindu Code Bills sought to codify and reform Hindu personal law covering marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption. They were among the most revolutionary pieces of legislation in Indian history—an attempt to transform Hindu society through law.</p>

            <div class="key-figure">
                <h4>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's Vision</h4>
                <p>As Law Minister, Ambedkar championed the Hindu Code Bills. For him, reforming Hindu law was essential to creating a just society. He saw traditional Hindu law as patriarchal and oppressive, particularly to women and lower castes.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Conservative Opposition</h2>
            <p>The bills faced fierce opposition from Hindu traditionalists. They argued that ancient Hindu law should not be tampered with by a modern legislature. Some objected to Ambedkar—a convert to Buddhism and critic of Hinduism—reforming Hindu law.</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>The Backlash</h4>
                <p>President Rajendra Prasad threatened to refuse assent. Senior Congressmen opposed reform. Hindu organizations organized protests. Ambedkar eventually resigned as Law Minister in 1951, partly due to frustration over the stalled reforms.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "The Hindu Code Bill is not merely a law but a social revolution which seeks to transform the basic structure of Hindu society."
                <cite>— Opponents of the Bill</cite>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Reforms Enacted</h2>
            <p>After Ambedkar's resignation, Nehru pushed through the reforms in pieces between 1955 and 1956. The comprehensive Hindu Code was broken into four separate acts.</p>

            <div class="milestone-box">
                <h4>The Four Acts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hindu Marriage Act (1955):</strong> Monogamy mandatory; divorce permitted</li>
                    <li><strong>Hindu Succession Act (1956):</strong> Women's property rights; daughters inherit</li>
                    <li><strong>Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act (1956):</strong> Women's guardianship rights</li>
                    <li><strong>Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (1956):</strong> Women can adopt; maintenance rights</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What the Reforms Changed</h2>
            <p>The reforms were revolutionary for their time. Women could now divorce abusive husbands. Daughters could inherit ancestral property. Polygamy was outlawed. Inter-caste marriages were legally recognized.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>Revolutionary Changes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monogamy became legally required for Hindus</li>
                    <li>Women gained the right to divorce</li>
                    <li>Daughters became coparceners (equal heirs to ancestral property, fully implemented only in 2005)</li>
                    <li>Inter-caste marriages were legally valid</li>
                    <li>Untouchability was no bar to marriage</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Muslim Question</h2>
            <p>One glaring omission: Muslim personal law was left untouched. Nehru argued that reforms should come from within the Muslim community. Critics saw this as inconsistent—reforming Hindu law by state action while leaving Muslim law to community preference.</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "If Hindu personal law could be reformed by act of Parliament, why not Muslim personal law? The answer was political—Nehru feared alienating Muslims after the trauma of partition."
                <cite>— Ramachandra Guha</cite>
            </div>

            <p>This asymmetry would become a lasting political controversy, with Hindu nationalists demanding a "Uniform Civil Code" and Muslims defending personal law autonomy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Abolishing Untouchability</h2>
            <p>The Constitution abolished untouchability, and the Untouchability Offences Act of 1955 made its practice a crime. But law and practice diverged dramatically. In villages across India, caste discrimination continued despite legal prohibition.</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>The Gap Between Law and Life</h4>
                <p>Dalits continued to face segregation, denied access to wells and temples. Atrocities continued. The law provided formal equality; social reality remained deeply unequal. Enforcement was weak, and caste prejudice persisted among police and officials.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Limits of Reform</h2>
            <p>The Hindu Code reforms were significant but incomplete. They applied only to Hindus (broadly defined to include Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains). Enforcement was uneven. Social change lagged behind legal change.</p>

            <p>Yet the reforms established principles that slowly transformed society. Over generations, women's property rights, divorce, and inter-caste marriage became more common. Law shaped society, even when society resisted.</p>
