        <div class="chapter-meta">Part III: Shaking the Centre (1964-1977)</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>By 1969, Indira Gandhi had transformed from the Syndicate's puppet to a populist leader who would crush her party bosses. This chapter examines her leftward turn, bank nationalization, the abolition of privy purses, and the "Garibi Hatao" campaign that remade Indian politics.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Breaking with the Syndicate</h2>
            <p>Indira chafed under the Syndicate's control. She needed an issue to establish independence. In 1969, she found one: the presidential election. When the party bosses backed their candidate, Indira supported an independent—and won.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>The Presidential Election of 1969</h4>
                <p>The Syndicate nominated N. Sanjiva Reddy for President. Indira supported V.V. Giri, urging Congressmen to vote their "conscience." Giri won with opposition support. The Syndicate's humiliation was complete. The Congress split.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Bank Nationalization</h2>
            <p>In July 1969, Indira nationalized India's 14 largest commercial banks. The move was immensely popular. Banks, seen as serving big business, would now serve the people. The Syndicate's attempts to reverse it failed.</p>

            <div class="historical-event">
                <h4>A Masterstroke</h4>
                <p>Bank nationalization achieved multiple goals: it established Indira as a socialist, differentiated her from the "old Congress," provided a popular issue, and gave the government control over credit allocation. Economically questionable, it was politically brilliant.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "The nationalization of banks was presented as a blow against monopoly capital and for the common man. In reality, it gave the government enormous patronage power."
                <cite>— Ramachandra Guha</cite>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Abolishing Privy Purses</h2>
            <p>The Constitution guaranteed former princes annual payments (privy purses) and privileges. Indira moved to abolish them. When the Supreme Court blocked the executive order, she had Parliament amend the Constitution.</p>

            <div class="milestone-box">
                <h4>Stripping the Princes</h4>
                <p>The 26th Amendment abolished privy purses in 1971. The princes—already anachronistic—were finally stripped of constitutional recognition. The move was popular and reinforced Indira's image as a democratic radical fighting privilege.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Congress Split</h2>
            <p>The battle with the Syndicate culminated in the Congress splitting in November 1969. The old Congress—Congress (O) for Organization—was led by the Syndicate. Indira's faction—Congress (R) for Requisition—had fewer MPs but popular support.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>Two Congresses</h4>
                <p>The split was a gamble. Congress (O) had the party machinery; Congress (R) had Indira. She bet that personal popularity would trump organizational strength. She was right—spectacularly so.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>"Garibi Hatao"</h2>
            <p>The 1971 election slogan "Garibi Hatao" (Abolish Poverty) captured Indira's populist appeal. Against the opposition's "Indira Hatao" (Remove Indira), she offered a positive, hope-filled message directed at the poor majority.</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "They say remove Indira. I say remove poverty. That is the difference between us."
                <cite>— Indira Gandhi, 1971</cite>
            </div>

            <p>The 1971 election was a landslide. Congress (R) won 352 seats; Congress (O) won just 16. The Syndicate was destroyed. Indira had absolute dominance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Populist Style</h2>
            <p>Indira pioneered a new style of Indian politics—direct appeal to the masses, bypassing party structures, cultivating a personal relationship with "the people" against "vested interests." This style would be imitated by many successors.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>Characteristics of Indira's Populism</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct appeal to masses over party intermediaries</li>
                    <li>Identification with the poor against elites</li>
                    <li>Personalization of power ("Indira is India")</li>
                    <li>Anti-institutional rhetoric</li>
                    <li>Centralization of decision-making</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Costs of Populism</h2>
            <p>Indira's triumph had a price. The Congress party was hollowed out—reduced to dependence on one person. Institutions were weakened. Merit gave way to loyalty. The seeds of authoritarian rule were planted.</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>Institutional Decay</h4>
                <p>The Congress transformed from a party with internal democracy and regional power centers into a personality cult. State chief ministers were appointed from Delhi. Dissent was punished. The party became an instrument of one person's will.</p>
