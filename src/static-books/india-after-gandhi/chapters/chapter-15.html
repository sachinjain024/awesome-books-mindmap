        <div class="chapter-meta">Part III: Shaking the Centre (1964-1977)</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War was India's most decisive military victory and Indira Gandhi's finest hour. This chapter tells the story of how East Pakistan became Bangladesh, with India's decisive intervention tipping the balance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Crisis in East Pakistan</h2>
            <p>East Pakistan—separated from West Pakistan by a thousand miles of Indian territory—had long been treated as a colony. Bengalis were underrepresented in the military and civil service. Their language and culture were marginalized.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>The Two Pakistans</h4>
                <p>West Pakistan dominated economically and politically despite East Pakistan having a larger population. Bengali demands for autonomy grew stronger. The Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, demanded greater provincial powers.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The 1970 Election</h2>
            <p>In December 1970, Pakistan held its first free national election. The Awami League won decisively, securing a majority in the National Assembly. Sheikh Mujib should have become Prime Minister of all Pakistan.</p>

            <div class="historical-event">
                <h4>Democracy Denied</h4>
                <p>The military and West Pakistani politicians refused to transfer power. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose PPP won in West Pakistan, would not accept Mujib as Prime Minister. Negotiations collapsed. The military prepared a crackdown.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Operation Searchlight</h2>
            <p>On March 25, 1971, the Pakistani army launched Operation Searchlight—a brutal crackdown on the Bengali population. The army targeted intellectuals, students, and Hindus. The scale of killing was genocidal.</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>The Genocide</h4>
                <p>Estimates of deaths range from 300,000 to 3 million. Rape was used systematically as a weapon of war. Universities were attacked. Hindu villages were targeted. Sheikh Mujib was arrested and taken to West Pakistan. Bangladesh declared independence—but had no army to defend it.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Refugee Crisis</h2>
            <p>Ten million refugees poured into India—the largest refugee crisis since partition. They concentrated in West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura, straining resources and threatening social stability.</p>

                <div class="stat-item">

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>India could not sustain this burden indefinitely. Intervention became not just a moral choice but an economic necessity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Indira's Diplomacy</h2>
            <p>Indira Gandhi toured the world, building support for intervention. She signed a treaty with the Soviet Union that neutralized the American threat to intervene on Pakistan's behalf. She waited for the optimal moment.</p>

            <div class="key-figure">
                <h4>Strategic Patience</h4>
                <p>Indira resisted pressure for early intervention. She wanted to wait until winter, when Himalayan passes would close, preventing Chinese intervention. She wanted diplomatic cover. She prepared meticulously—then struck decisively.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The War</h2>
            <p>On December 3, 1971, Pakistan attacked Indian airfields in the west—giving India the pretext for open intervention. Indian forces, supported by Bengali guerrillas (Mukti Bahini), swept through East Pakistan.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Victory</h2>
            <p>In just 13 days, India achieved total victory. East Pakistan became Bangladesh. 93,000 Pakistani soldiers became prisoners of war. Pakistan was dismembered—a humiliation from which it never recovered psychologically.</p>

            <div class="milestone-box">
                <h4>Indira's Triumph</h4>
                <p>Indira Gandhi was at the peak of her power and popularity. She was compared to Durga, the warrior goddess. The victory erased the humiliation of 1962 and established India as the dominant power in South Asia.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
            <p>The Simla Agreement of 1972 saw Pakistan accept the new reality. The POWs were returned. The Line of Control in Kashmir was formalized. But lasting peace remained elusive—Pakistan's military never forgave the humiliation.</p>
