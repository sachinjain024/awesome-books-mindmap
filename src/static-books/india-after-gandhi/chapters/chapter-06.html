        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 6: Ideas of India</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part I: Picking Up the Pieces (1947-1949)</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The Constitution of India, adopted on January 26, 1950, was not just a legal document—it was a statement of national purpose. This chapter examines the debates in the Constituent Assembly and the competing visions of what independent India should become.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Constituent Assembly</h2>
            <p>The Constituent Assembly, elected in 1946, began as a body for all of British India. After partition, it became India's constitution-making body. The Assembly included representatives of all regions, religions, and ideologies—a remarkable collection of lawyers, freedom fighters, and intellectuals.</p>

            <div class="key-figure">
                <h4>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</h4>
                <p>As Chairman of the Drafting Committee, Ambedkar was the principal architect of the Constitution. A Dalit who had faced discrimination throughout his life, he crafted a document that enshrined equality and abolished untouchability. His legal brilliance shaped India's fundamental law.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "We are going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality... We must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment, or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy."
                <cite>— Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, November 25, 1949</cite>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Constitutional Debates</h2>
            <p>The Assembly debated every provision extensively. Members argued about federalism, language, religion, caste, and rights. The debates reveal the competing visions that shaped modern India.</p>

            <div class="political-analysis">
                <h4>Key Contested Issues</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Federalism:</strong> How much power for states vs. the center?</li>
                    <li><strong>Language:</strong> Should Hindi become the national language?</li>
                    <li><strong>Religion:</strong> Should India be explicitly secular?</li>
                    <li><strong>Caste:</strong> How to address historical discrimination?</li>
                    <li><strong>Property:</strong> Should there be a right to property?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Language Question</h2>
            <p>Perhaps no issue generated more heat than language. Hindi-speaking members wanted Hindi as the sole national language. South Indians, who did not speak Hindi, resisted what they saw as "Hindi imperialism."</p>

            <div class="crisis-box">
                <h4>Hindi vs. English</h4>
                <p>The compromise: Hindi would be the official language, but English would continue for 15 years—and longer if Parliament decided. This satisfied no one fully but prevented a split. The language issue would continue to roil Indian politics for decades.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Secularism and Minority Rights</h2>
            <p>India chose to be a secular state—but what did that mean? Not the American separation of church and state, but rather equal treatment of all religions. The state could engage with religion; it just couldn't favor any one religion.</p>

            <p>Special provisions protected minority rights: freedom of religion, protection of minority educational institutions, and prohibitions on discrimination. The Constitution tried to balance individual rights with community protections.</p>

            <div class="milestone-box">
                <h4>Abolition of Untouchability</h4>
                <p>Article 17 abolished untouchability "and its practice in any form is forbidden." For the first time in Indian history, caste discrimination was constitutionally prohibited. Enforcement would be another matter, but the legal foundation was laid.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reservations and Affirmative Action</h2>
            <p>The Constitution included provisions for reservations (quotas) for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in education, employment, and legislatures. This was India's affirmative action program—an attempt to remedy centuries of discrimination.</p>

            <p>These provisions were meant to be temporary—10 years initially—but have been extended repeatedly. They remain controversial, with debates about whether they help the intended beneficiaries or perpetuate caste consciousness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles</h2>
            <p>The Constitution guaranteed fundamental rights—enforceable in court—including equality, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and protection against discrimination. These were inspired by the US Bill of Rights.</p>

            <p>It also included Directive Principles of State Policy—goals like universal education, a living wage, and equal pay—that were not enforceable but provided guidance for policy. This was inspired by the Irish Constitution.</p>

            <div class="historical-quote">
                "The Constitution is not a mere lawyers' document, it is a vehicle of Life, and its spirit is always the spirit of the Age."
                <cite>— Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</cite>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Republic Day</h2>
            <p>The Constitution came into effect on January 26, 1950—chosen because January 26 had been celebrated as "Independence Day" by the Congress since 1930. India became a sovereign democratic republic, with a President as head of state and a Prime Minister as head of government.</p>
