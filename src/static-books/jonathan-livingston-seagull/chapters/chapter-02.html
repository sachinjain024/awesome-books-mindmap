        <h1 class="chapter-title">Part 2: The Higher Flock</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Jonathan Livingston Seagull</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Jonathan is taken to a new realm where gulls spend their days perfecting flight and learning. He meets Chiang, the elder who teaches him that true flight comes from knowing he is free—and that heaven is not a place, but perfection itself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>A New Kind of Flock</h2>
            <p>In this world, every gull is devoted to learning. There is no hierarchy of age or strength—only the shared pursuit of getting better. Jonathan fits in at last. Here, his passion is the norm.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Heaven is not a place, and it is not a time. Heaven is being perfect."
                <div class="attribution">— Chiang, Jonathan Livingston Seagull</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Chiang's Teaching</h2>
            <p>Chiang shows Jonathan that the secret of instant travel—and of all true flight—is to know that you are already free. You are not a body with limits; you are perfect, unlimited idea. The moment you fully believe that, you can do the "impossible."</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Freedom is not given by the world; it is the realization that you were never bound. The only thing standing in your way is the belief that you are limited.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Passing On</h2>
            <p>Chiang eventually disappears into thin air, leaving Jonathan with the same understanding: you have the freedom to be yourself, here and now. Jonathan decides he is ready to return to Earth and teach others who are willing to see.</p>
