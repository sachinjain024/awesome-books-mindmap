            <h2>About This Mind Map</h2>
            <p>Richard Bach's fable follows a seagull who refuses to live only for food and survival. Jonathan chooses to master flight for its own sake—and in doing so, breaks free from the flock and discovers a higher realm of possibility and purpose.</p>

                <h3>Core Teachings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Excellence for its own sake</strong> — Pursue mastery not for reward but for the joy of the craft.</li>
                    <li><strong>Break from the flock</strong> — Conformity limits growth; sometimes you must leave to find your path.</li>
                    <li><strong>You are free</strong> — The only thing standing between you and your potential is the belief that you're limited.</li>
                    <li><strong>Love and forgiveness</strong> — The only law that matters; use them to lift others.</li>
