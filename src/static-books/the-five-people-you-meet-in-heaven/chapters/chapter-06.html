        <div class="chapter-meta">The Five People You Meet in Heaven</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Eddie understands his life. He is at peace. He learns that the little girl he died saving is safe. He is reunited with those he loved. Heaven, for Eddie, is not a reward—it is understanding. He can finally rest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Understanding</h2>
            <p>Each of the five people gave Eddie a piece of the puzzle: connection, sacrifice, forgiveness, love, purpose. He is no longer angry at his father, guilty about the Blue Man or the captain or the fire, or convinced that his life was small. He sees that he was part of something larger—and that he made a difference.</p>

            <h2>Reunion</h2>
            <p>Eddie is reunited with Marguerite and with the people he has loved. The little girl he saved is alive. In the logic of the novel, heaven is the place where we see that no life is random, no love is lost, and no sacrifice is meaningless. Eddie's story ends in peace.</p>
