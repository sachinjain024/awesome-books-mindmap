            <h2>The Prison of Labels</h2>
            <p>Children are often cast in roles - by parents, siblings, teachers, even themselves. "She's the shy one." "He's the troublemaker." "She's the smart one." These labels, even positive ones, can become self-fulfilling prophecies that limit who a child can become.</p>

            <p>Once a child is labeled, everyone starts seeing them through that lens. The "difficult" child's reasonable behavior goes unnoticed, while any challenging moment confirms the label. The child eventually gives up trying to be different - they become the label.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <h4>How Labels Limit</h4>
            <p><strong>"The shy one"</strong> → Never gets pushed to try social situations → Stays shy</p>
            <p><strong>"The clumsy one"</strong> → Avoids sports and physical activities → Stays uncoordinated</p>
            <p><strong>"The smart one"</strong> → Afraid to try hard things and fail → Avoids challenges</p>
            <p><strong>"The difficult one"</strong> → Gets treated with suspicion → Acts out more</p>
            <p>Even "positive" labels limit children to one narrow identity.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Six Skills for Freeing Children from Roles</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-box">
            <h3>Skill 1: Look for Opportunities to Show the Child a New Picture of Themselves</h3>
            <div class="skill-steps">
                <li>Catch the child being different from their label</li>
                <li>Point out evidence that contradicts the role</li>
                <li>Be genuine - don't make things up</li>
                <li>Small observations can shift self-image over time</li>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-dialogue">
            <h4>Example: The "Disorganized" Child</h4>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> I noticed you packed your own backpack last night and remembered everything you needed for school. You even put your permission slip right in the front pocket.
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line child">
                <span class="speaker">Child:</span> Yeah, I didn't want to forget it.
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> That's the kind of planning ahead that really helps.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-box">
            <h3>Skill 2: Put Children in Situations Where They Can See Themselves Differently</h3>
            <div class="skill-steps">
                <li>Create opportunities for the child to act outside their role</li>
                <li>Set up for success with appropriate challenges</li>
                <li>Let them experience themselves in a new way</li>
                <li>Experience is more powerful than words</li>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-dialogue">
            <h4>Example: The "Selfish" Child</h4>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> Grandma's coming for dinner. Would you be in charge of making sure she has everything she needs? You could show her where to sit and make sure her water glass is full.
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic; color: #64748b;">This gives the "selfish" child a chance to practice being considerate - and to see themselves as someone who can take care of others.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-box">
            <h3>Skill 3: Let Children Overhear You Say Something Positive About Them</h3>
            <div class="skill-steps">
                <li>Children believe what they "accidentally" hear more than direct praise</li>
                <li>Talk positively about the child to another adult (within earshot)</li>
                <li>Be specific about behavior that contradicts the old role</li>
                <li>This feels more authentic than direct praise</li>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-dialogue">
            <h4>Example: The "Quitter"</h4>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent (on phone, knowing child can hear):</span> Jamie had a really hard time with that science project at first. But you know what? She kept at it. Tried different approaches. Didn't give up even when she got frustrated. I was really impressed.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-box">
            <h3>Skill 4: Model the Behavior You'd Like to See</h3>
            <div class="skill-steps">
                <li>Children learn more from what we do than what we say</li>
                <li>Show them how to handle situations differently</li>
                <li>Let them see you working on your own challenges</li>
                <li>Talk about your own growth and change</li>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-dialogue">
            <h4>Example: For the "Angry" Child</h4>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> Ugh, I'm really frustrated right now because I can't find my keys. I'm going to take a deep breath... Okay. Let me think about where I last had them.
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic; color: #64748b;">This models how to handle frustration without exploding - something the "angry" child can observe and eventually imitate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-box">
            <h3>Skill 5: Be a Storehouse for Your Child's Special Moments</h3>
            <div class="skill-steps">
                <li>Remember and remind children of times they acted outside their role</li>
                <li>Bring up past examples when relevant</li>
                <li>Help them see patterns of positive behavior</li>
                <li>This builds a counter-narrative to the limiting label</li>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-dialogue">
            <h4>Example: The "Mean" Sibling</h4>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> Remember last month when your brother was scared at the doctor's office? You held his hand and told him it would be okay. He said later that made him feel better.
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line child">
                <span class="speaker">Child:</span> Oh yeah... I did do that.
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> You did. You can be really kind when you want to be.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-box">
            <h3>Skill 6: When the Child Acts According to the Old Label, State Your Feelings and Expectations</h3>
            <div class="skill-steps">
                <li>Don't say "There you go again" or "That's so typical of you"</li>
                <li>Instead, express how you feel and what you expect</li>
                <li>Treat this as a temporary slip, not confirmation of identity</li>
                <li>Show that you still see them as capable of better</li>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="comparison">
            <div class="comparison-item dont">
                <h4>Confirming the Label:</h4>
                <p>"See, there you go being selfish again. You never share. You're always so selfish."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-item do">
                <h4>Separating Action from Identity:</h4>
                <p>"I'm disappointed that the toys weren't shared. I know you can be generous - I've seen it. I expect sharing in this family."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Labels in the Family System</h2>
            <p>Sometimes family roles become complementary: if one child is "the responsible one," another becomes "the irresponsible one." These roles can be hard to change because the whole family system depends on them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid comparing siblings</li>
                <li>Let each child be a complex individual</li>
                <li>Don't assign roles ("You're the organized one, you pack the car")</li>
                <li>Give all children opportunities to develop various qualities</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="technique-description">
                <p><strong>1. Examine:</strong> What labels does this child carry? What roles have they been cast in?</p>
                <p><strong>2. Watch:</strong> Look for any behavior that contradicts the label</p>
                <p><strong>3. Describe:</strong> Point out the evidence of the "new" behavior</p>
                <p><strong>4. Create:</strong> Set up situations where they can act differently</p>
                <p><strong>5. Remember:</strong> Store and recall their best moments</p>
                <p><strong>6. Persist:</strong> Change takes time - keep seeing them as capable of growth</p>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways from Chapter 6</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Labels limit:</strong> Even "positive" labels can trap children in narrow identities</li>
                <li><strong>Show new pictures:</strong> Catch them acting outside their role</li>
                <li><strong>Create opportunities:</strong> Set up situations for different behavior</li>
                <li><strong>Let them overhear:</strong> Positive comments "accidentally" heard are powerful</li>
                <li><strong>Model change:</strong> Show how you work on your own growth</li>
                <li><strong>Remember the good:</strong> Be a storehouse of their best moments</li>
                <li><strong>Expect more:</strong> When they slip, express faith in their ability to do better</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="quick-reference">
            <h4>Labels to Watch For</h4>
            <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Shy, lazy, clumsy, selfish, difficult, stubborn, irresponsible, mean, slow, wild</p>
            <p><strong>"Positive" but Limiting:</strong> The smart one, the pretty one, the athletic one, the responsible one, the easy one, the funny one</p>
            <p><strong>Better approach:</strong> See children as complex people capable of many qualities</p>
