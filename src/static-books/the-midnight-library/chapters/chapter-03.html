        <div class="intro">
            <p>Nora tries the life where she stayed in the band with her brother—they're famous, but the cost is exhaustion and distance. She tries the life where she married Dan—they have a house and a child, but the marriage is unhappy. She begins to see that no path is the "right" one; every life has trade-offs.</p>

            <h2>The Band Life</h2>
            <p>In this life Nora and her brother's band made it. She is a successful musician—but she is tired, disconnected, and her brother is still hard to reach. The thing she regretted leaving did not become a simple happy ending. Success in one dimension does not fix the rest of life.</p>

            <h2>The Life with Dan</h2>
            <p>Nora married Dan. They have a daughter and a home. But Dan is not the right person for her in this timeline either—the marriage is strained. Nora realizes that the life she fantasized about (married to Dan) is not the paradise she imagined. Regret had painted it in gold; reality is more ordinary and more complicated.</p>

                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>We often regret not having a life we've only imagined. When we "try" it, we see its flaws. That doesn't mean our current life is better—but it means the other life was never the perfect answer.</p>
