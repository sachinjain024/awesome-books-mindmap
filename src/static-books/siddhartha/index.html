            <h2>About This Mind Map</h2>
            <p>Hermann Hesse's novel follows Siddhartha from his Brahmin upbringing through asceticism, sensual life, and wealth, to the river and the ferryman. It is a story about finding wisdom not through doctrine but through lived experience and the unity of all things.</p>

                <h3>Core Teachings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Experience over doctrine</strong> — Wisdom cannot be handed down; it must be lived.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your path is yours</strong> — Even the Buddha's teaching is a map, not the territory.</li>
                    <li><strong>The river</strong> — Time and the present are one; the river holds all voices and all times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Om</strong> — The sound of wholeness; acceptance of what is, and love for the world.</li>
