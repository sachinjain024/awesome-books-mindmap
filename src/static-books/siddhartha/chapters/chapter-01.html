        <div class="chapter-meta">Siddhartha</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Siddhartha is beloved by his father and the Brahmins, but his soul is restless. He and his friend Govinda leave home to join the Samanas—wandering ascetics—in the hope of finding the Atman, the inner self.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Leaving Home</h2>
            <p>Siddhartha has learned the rituals and scriptures, but he feels that the Brahmins have not found the innermost thing—they have only passed down words. He decides to go with the Samanas. His father resists but finally allows him to leave.</p>

                "Within you there is a stillness and a sanctuary to which you can retreat at any time."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Life with the Samanas</h2>
            <p>Siddhartha practices fasting, holding his breath, and enduring pain. He learns to lose the self in the forest, to become empty—but after years he realizes that escaping the self through techniques only leads to temporary numbness. The self always returns.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Asceticism can quiet the ego, but it does not necessarily reveal the true self. Siddhartha begins to see that the path might not be denial but something else—experience, acceptance, or the world itself.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Restlessness can be a sign that doctrine alone is not enough.</li>
                <li>Leaving home is the first step toward finding your own path.</li>
                <li>Denial of the body and the self does not destroy the self—it only hides it.</li>
                <li>True wisdom may require more than technique; it may require living.</li>
            </ul>
