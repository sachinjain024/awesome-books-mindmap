        <div class="chapter-meta">A Man Called Ove</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>We learn how Ove became Ove. His mother died young; his father raised him with strict principles and quiet love. His father died; Ove lost his house in a fire. He met Sonja—she was a teacher, full of life and books. They married. She was in a bus crash and spent the rest of her life in a wheelchair; Ove cared for her and built ramps and adapted their life. When she died, he lost his reason to live. The past explains the grumpy man—and the man capable of great love.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Sonja and Loss</h2>
            <p>Sonja was Ove's opposite—warm, talkative, full of color. She gave him a life beyond rules and work. When the bus crash took her mobility, she didn't lose her spirit—but Ove had to learn to live with fear and care. When she died of cancer, he was left with nothing. His plan to join her is an expression of that loss—and of loyalty.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the greatest motivations for living."

            <h4>Key Insight</h4>
            <p>Ove's grumpiness is the surface. Underneath is a man who loved deeply and lost. The neighbors don't replace Sonja—but they give him a new way to live without her. Death can motivate us to live when we find something worth staying for.</p>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss can strip us of the will to live—and loyalty to the dead can feel like a reason to go.</li>
                <li>Understanding someone's past explains their present—Ove's rigidity and grief make sense.</li>
                <li>New purpose doesn't replace the one we lost—it adds to it.</li>
            </ul>
