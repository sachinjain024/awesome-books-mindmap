            <h2>About This Mind Map</h2>
            <p>Ove is a grumpy, rule-obsessed widower who has decided life is no longer worth living. When new neighbors—a pregnant woman, her husband, and their two daughters—crash into his world, they refuse to leave him alone. Backman's novel is about how purpose and connection can return even when we've given up—and how we are never too old to be needed.</p>

                <h3>Core Teachings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose</strong> — Being needed gives life meaning; we are never too old to be useful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community</strong> — Neighbors and small acts of help can save us when we've given up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Love and loss</strong> — Ove's grumpiness hides grief; connection can bring him back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second chances</strong> — It's never too late to let people in and to find a reason to stay.</li>
