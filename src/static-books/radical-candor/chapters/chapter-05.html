        <div class="intro">
            <p>Not everyone wants to climb the corporate ladder. Some people want rapid career growth; others want to excel at what they do without taking on management. Both paths are valid, and great bosses understand what each person on their team wants.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Career Ladder Myth</h2>
            <p>Organizations assume everyone wants to move "up." But for many people, moving into management means doing less of what they love.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Problem with "Up or Out"</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loses great individual contributors by forcing them into management</li>
                    <li>Creates bad managers (people who don't want to manage)</li>
                    <li>Punishes people who want to stay excellent at their craft</li>
                    <li>Assumes ambition only means climbing the ladder</li>
                    <li>Ignores people's actual motivations and strengths</li>

            <h2>Steep Growth Trajectory vs. Gradual Growth Trajectory</h2>
            <p>Kim Scott proposes two valid career trajectories: people on a steep growth trajectory (ambitious for new challenges and promotions) and people on a gradual growth trajectory (ambitious for excellence in their current role).</p>

            <div class="comparison-box">
                <h4>Two Valid Paths</h4>

                        <h5>Steep Growth Trajectory</h5>
                        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wants rapid career progression</li>
                            <li>Seeks new challenges constantly</li>
                            <li>Willing to change roles, teams, or companies</li>
                            <li>Energized by learning new things</li>
                            <li>Thrives on increased responsibility</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Your role as boss:</strong> Give stretch assignments, promotions, new challenges</p>

                            <li>May have priorities outside work (family, hobbies)</li>
                            <li>Not less ambitious—differently ambitious</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Your role as boss:</strong> Honor their choice, give opportunities for mastery, protect from "up or out" pressure</p>

            <h2>Trajectories Change</h2>
            <p>People move between trajectories throughout their careers. Someone might be on a steep trajectory, then shift to gradual after having kids—then shift back years later. The key is staying in conversation.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Life Changes Career Trajectories</h4>
                <p>Events that might shift someone's trajectory:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having children or caring for aging parents</li>
                    <li>Dealing with health issues</li>
                    <li>Pursuing education or a passion project</li>
                    <li>Recovering from burnout</li>
                    <li>Changing personal priorities</li>
                    <li>Achieving a long-term goal</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your job isn't to judge these choices—it's to understand them and adapt.</p>

                "Part of your job as a boss is to put people in roles where they can grow, whether they want to grow into management or deeper into a technical or creative area."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Avoiding the "Rockstar" and "Superstar" Labels</h2>
            <p>Scott initially used "rockstar" (gradual growth) and "superstar" (steep growth) terminology but later regretted it. Labels feel judgmental and miss the point: both paths are equally valuable.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Don't Label People</h4>
                <p>Instead of labeling people, have conversations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"What do you want to learn this year?"</li>
                    <li>"Are you happy in your current role?"</li>
                    <li>"What would growth look like for you?"</li>
                    <li>"What are your priorities outside of work right now?"</li>
                    <li>"How can I support you in what you want to achieve?"</li>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Building a Balanced Team</h2>
            <p>Great teams need both types of people. If everyone is on a steep trajectory, you'll have constant turnover. If everyone is on a gradual trajectory, you won't have enough leaders developing.</p>

            <div class="care-box">
                <h4>The Balanced Team</h4>
                <p>A healthy team has:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>People on steep trajectories:</strong> Bring energy, drive change, take on new initiatives</li>
                    <li><strong>People on gradual trajectories:</strong> Bring stability, deep expertise, institutional knowledge</li>
                    <li><strong>Mutual respect:</strong> Neither path is seen as "better"</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> People can shift trajectories as life changes</li>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Not everyone wants to climb the ladder—and that's okay</li>
                <li>Steep growth trajectory: ambitious for promotion and new challenges</li>
                <li>Gradual growth trajectory: ambitious for excellence in current role</li>
                <li>Both trajectories are equally valid and valuable</li>
                <li>People shift between trajectories as life circumstances change</li>
