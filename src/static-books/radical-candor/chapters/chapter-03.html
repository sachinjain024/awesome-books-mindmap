        <div class="chapter-meta">Part 2: Get, Give, and Encourage Guidance</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Most people dramatically under-praise. They save praise for big achievements and ignore the daily work that deserves recognition. Effective praise is specific, sincere, and immediate—and it's not optional.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Praise Matters</h2>
            <p>Praise isn't just "nice to have"—it's critical for learning and motivation. People need to know what they're doing well so they can do more of it.</p>

            <div class="care-box">
                <h4>The Purpose of Praise</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shows people what "good" looks like</li>
                    <li>Reinforces behaviors you want to see more of</li>
                    <li>Builds confidence and trust</li>
                    <li>Makes criticism easier to hear later</li>
                    <li>Prevents people from questioning their value</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Be Specific</h2>
            <p>Generic praise ("great job!") is forgettable and ineffective. Specific praise tells people exactly what they did well.</p>

            <div class="comparison-box">
                <h4>Generic vs. Specific Praise</h4>
                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div class="comparison-column bad">
                        <h5>Generic (Weak)</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Nice work on the presentation!"</li>
                            <li>"You're a great employee"</li>
                            <li>"Keep it up!"</li>
                            <li>"Good job on the project"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column good">
                        <h5>Specific (Strong)</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Your opening story grabbed everyone's attention—that's exactly how to start a pitch"</li>
                            <li>"The way you debugged that issue by checking logs first saved us hours"</li>
                            <li>"You asked clarifying questions that prevented a major misunderstanding"</li>
                            <li>"The documentation you wrote made onboarding the new hire seamless"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Be Sincere</h2>
            <p>People can detect fake praise instantly. If you don't mean it, don't say it. And never praise someone just to soften upcoming criticism.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Avoid These Praise Mistakes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The "praise sandwich":</strong> Praise → Criticism → Praise (people see through this)</li>
                    <li><strong>Personality praise:</strong> "You're so smart" (focuses on identity, not actions)</li>
                    <li><strong>Insincere praise:</strong> Praising something mediocre just to be nice</li>
                    <li><strong>Public praise for private people:</strong> Know your audience</li>
                    <li><strong>Comparison praise:</strong> "You're better than [colleague]" (creates competition)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Praise Immediately and In Person</h2>
            <p>Praise loses impact when delayed. Give it as soon as you notice something praise-worthy. And whenever possible, do it face-to-face.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>The HIP Principle (for Praise)</h4>
                <p>Make praise:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Helpful:</strong> Tells them what to keep doing</li>
                    <li><strong>Immediate:</strong> Given right away, not weeks later</li>
                    <li><strong>In Person:</strong> Or at least via video call, not just Slack</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Praise in Public (Usually)</h2>
            <p>Most people appreciate public recognition, but know your team. Some people find public praise embarrassing.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Public vs. Private Praise</h4>
                <p><strong>Public praise works when:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The person enjoys recognition</li>
                    <li>It sets an example for others</li>
                    <li>The achievement deserves celebration</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Private praise works when:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The person is shy or introverted</li>
                    <li>The praise is for personal growth</li>
                    <li>Public attention would embarrass them</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
