        <div class="chapter-meta">Part 2: Get, Give, and Encourage Guidance</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Before you can give feedback effectively, you need to show you can receive it. Leaders who don't solicit criticism create cultures where bad news is hidden. This chapter shows how to encourage people to challenge you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Getting Feedback Is Hard</h2>
            <p>There's a power dynamic problem: people are afraid to criticize their boss. Even if you want feedback, people won't give it because they fear consequences.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Power Dynamic Problem</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your team fears being fired or demoted</li>
                    <li>They worry about hurting your feelings</li>
                    <li>They've learned from past bosses to stay quiet</li>
                    <li>You have more power than you realize</li>
                    <li>Saying "my door is always open" isn't enough</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Have a Go-To Question</h2>
            <p>Don't ask vague questions like "Do you have any feedback?" Instead, ask a specific question that's easy to answer.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Kim Scott's Go-To Question</h4>
                <p class="quote-style">"Is there anything I could do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?"</p>
                <p>This question:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is specific and actionable</li>
                    <li>Shows you want to improve</li>
                    <li>Makes it about their experience, not your ego</li>
                    <li>Asks about behavior (what you do), not who you are</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Embrace the Discomfort</h2>
            <p>When someone finally gives you criticism, your instinct will be to defend yourself or explain. Don't. Count to six and just listen.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>The Six-Second Rule</h4>
                <p>When you receive criticism, force yourself to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Listen:</strong> Don't interrupt or defend</li>
                    <li><strong>Count to six:</strong> Force a pause before responding</li>
                    <li><strong>Reward the candor:</strong> Say "Thank you" genuinely</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask clarifying questions:</strong> Show you want to understand</li>
                    <li><strong>Commit to action:</strong> Explain what you'll do differently</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The single most important thing a boss can do is focus on guidance: giving it, receiving it, and encouraging it."

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reward the Candor</h2>
            <p>If someone gives you criticism and you react defensively, you've just taught everyone never to challenge you again. You must visibly reward candor.</p>

            <div class="care-box">
                <h4>How to Reward Candor</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Say thank you:</strong> Mean it. Make eye contact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask follow-up questions:</strong> Show you're taking it seriously</li>
                    <li><strong>Make a visible change:</strong> Fix the issue they raised</li>
                    <li><strong>Report back:</strong> Tell them what you did based on their feedback</li>
                    <li><strong>Give credit:</strong> Publicly acknowledge their help</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Management "Fix-It" Weeks</h2>
            <p>Sheryl Sandberg at Facebook instituted "fix-it" weeks where the team would list all the annoying things about how she managed—and she'd fix them.</p>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h4>Example: The Fix-It List</h4>
                <p>Common items on fix-it lists:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"You interrupt people in meetings"</li>
                    <li>"You schedule meetings that run over lunch"</li>
                    <li>"You change priorities without warning"</li>
                    <li>"You're always on your phone during one-on-ones"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The boss commits to fixing these items and reports back on progress.</p>
