        <div class="chapter-meta">Part 1: Our Need to Feel Safe</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Sinek opens with the story of Captain Mike Swenson, a Marine who received the Medal of Honor for running into enemy fire to rescue wounded soldiers. The story raises a profound question: Why would someone willingly sacrifice themselves for others? The answer reveals the foundation of great leadership.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Story of Captain Swenson</h2>
            <p>On September 8, 2009, in Afghanistan, Captain Swenson's unit was ambushed. Despite being outnumbered and under intense fire, Swenson repeatedly exposed himself to danger to rescue wounded soldiers and recover the fallen.</p>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h4>The Helmet Camera Footage</h4>
                <p>A helmet camera captured Swenson in the back of a medevac helicopter, leaning over a wounded soldier. He gently kissed the soldier on the head before the helicopter took off. This single act of compassion amid chaos revealed something profound about leadership and human connection.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The true price of leadership is the willingness to place the needs of others above your own. Great leaders truly care about those they are privileged to lead and understand that the true cost of the leadership privilege comes at the expense of self-interest."
                <div class="attribution">— Simon Sinek</div>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Would Anyone Do That?</h2>
            <p>Swenson's actions weren't unique to him. Throughout military history, people have risked—and given—their lives for comrades. The question is: why?</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>The Answer: Trust and Safety</h4>
                <p>When we feel safe among the people we work with, when we feel protected by our leaders, we naturally cooperate to face outside dangers and seize opportunities. But when we don't feel safe, we spend our energy protecting ourselves from each other.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Circle of Safety</h2>
            <p>Great leaders create what Sinek calls a "Circle of Safety"—an environment where people feel they belong, where they trust each other and their leaders.</p>

            <div class="safety-box">
                <h4>Inside the Circle</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>People feel valued and protected</li>
                    <li>Energy is directed outward—toward opportunities and threats</li>
                    <li>Cooperation happens naturally</li>
                    <li>People willingly sacrifice for each other</li>
                    <li>Innovation and risk-taking are possible</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Outside the Circle</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>People feel vulnerable and exposed</li>
                    <li>Energy is directed inward—protecting yourself</li>
                    <li>Politics and self-interest dominate</li>
                    <li>People hoard information and resources</li>
                    <li>Fear prevents innovation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Leaders Eat Last</h2>
            <p>The title comes from a Marine Corps tradition: officers eat after their subordinates. The most junior Marines eat first, the most senior officers eat last.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>The Symbolism</h4>
                <p>This tradition symbolizes that leaders sacrifice their comfort for the good of those in their care. True leaders don't consume first—they ensure others are taken care of. This builds the trust necessary for the group to function.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Business Parallel</h2>
            <p>The same dynamics that create trust in military units apply to businesses and organizations. When leaders protect their people from internal threats (politics, layoffs, favoritism), those people can focus on external challenges.</p>
