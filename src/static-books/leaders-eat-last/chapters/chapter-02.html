        <div class="chapter-meta">Part 1: Our Need to Feel Safe</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>When companies treat employees as expenses to be managed rather than people to be valued, something fundamental breaks. This chapter explores what happens when organizations forget that employees are human beings with needs, fears, and aspirations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Numbers Game</h2>
            <p>Many companies manage by spreadsheet. Employees become "headcount," "resources," or "human capital"—numbers to be optimized for quarterly results.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>When People Become Numbers</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Layoffs are announced to boost stock price</li>
                    <li>Bonuses go to executives while workers are cut</li>
                    <li>People are "resources" to be allocated</li>
                    <li>Loyalty becomes a one-way street</li>

            <h2>Bob Chapman and Barry-Wehmiller</h2>
            <p>Bob Chapman, CEO of Barry-Wehmiller, implemented the furlough program with a powerful message to employees:</p>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h4>Chapman's Message</h4>
                <p>"It is better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot."</p>
                <p>Employees could take the four weeks whenever they wanted. Some took Fridays off to extend weekends. Others saved weeks for later. The company survived without layoffs, and loyalty soared.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Discretionary Effort</h2>
            <p>When people feel valued, they give something invaluable: discretionary effort—the extra mile that can't be measured or mandated.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>What Is Discretionary Effort?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Staying late to help a colleague</li>
                    <li>Going above and beyond for customers</li>
                    <li>Innovating and problem-solving</li>
                    <li>Protecting the company's interests</li>
                    <li>Mentoring others</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can't demand discretionary effort. It's freely given—but only when people feel safe and valued.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Cost of Not Caring</h2>
            <p>When companies don't care about their people, the costs are real but often invisible:</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Hidden Costs of Low Trust</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Employees do minimum required work</li>
                    <li>Innovation disappears</li>
                    <li>Customer service suffers</li>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Treating employees as numbers destroys trust and discretionary effort</li>
                <li>When leaders sacrifice for their people, loyalty deepens</li>
                <li>Sharing pain equally (like Barry-Wehmiller's furloughs) builds trust</li>
                <li>Discretionary effort can't be mandated—it's freely given when people feel valued</li>
                <li>The costs of not caring are real but often invisible</li>
