        <div class="chapter-meta">Part 1: Our Need to Feel Safe</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Sinek addresses common objections to creating safety: "But what about performance?" "What about accountability?" "Won't people get complacent?" The answers reveal why safety actually enables higher performance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Objection 1: What About Performance?</h2>
            <p>The concern: If people feel too safe, won't they become lazy?</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>The Reality</h4>
                <p>Safety doesn't mean no expectations. It means people can focus on meeting those expectations instead of worrying about office politics or job security. High-performing teams have both high standards AND high safety.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Objection 2: What About Accountability?</h2>
            <p>Safety doesn't eliminate accountability—it makes it possible. When people feel safe, they:</p>

            <div class="safety-box">
                <h4>Accountability in Safe Environments</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Admit mistakes openly (instead of hiding them)</li>
                    <li>Ask for help when struggling</li>
                    <li>Hold each other accountable (peer pressure works)</li>
                    <li>Take responsibility for outcomes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Objection 3: Not Everyone Deserves Trust</h2>
            <p>True—some people abuse trust. But this reveals a selection and culture problem, not a reason to abandon trust.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Building Trust</h4>
                <p>Start with trust, verify through behavior. When someone violates trust, address it directly. But don't punish everyone for one person's failure by removing trust from the whole organization.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Safety and high standards aren't opposites—they enable each other</li>
                <li>Accountability works better when people feel safe to admit mistakes</li>
                <li>Trust isn't naive—it's the foundation for performance</li>
                <li>Address trust violations individually, don't punish everyone</li>
            </ul>
