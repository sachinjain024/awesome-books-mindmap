## About the Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita ("Song of God") is a 700-verse conversation between Lord Krishna and the warrior Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Set within the epic Mahabharata, it addresses life's fundamental questions:

- Who am I?
- What is my purpose?
- How should I act in this world?
- What happens after death?
- What is the nature of God?

The Gita's teachings transcend religious boundaries, offering practical wisdom on duty, action, knowledge, devotion, and self-realization.

Foundation teachings on the soul, detached action, and controlling the mind through meditation.

Krishna reveals His divine nature, opulences, universal form, and the supremacy of devotional service.
