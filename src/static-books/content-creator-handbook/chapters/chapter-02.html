            <div class="insight-text">"Everyone starts for the money or the fame. The ones who last found something deeper along the way — or they burn out."</div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Purpose Problem</h2>
            <p>Most creators start for surface-level reasons: money, fame, influence, or because they saw someone else succeed. These motivations aren't wrong, but they're insufficient. They won't sustain you through the months (or years) of publishing into the void before anything "works."</p>
            <p>Your "why" needs to be strong enough to survive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Videos that get 47 views</li>
                <li>Negative comments from strangers</li>
                <li>Friends and family who don't understand</li>
                <li>The temptation to quit when results don't come fast</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h3>Layers of Why</h3>
            <p>Your motivation has layers. The deeper you go, the more sustainable it becomes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Surface:</strong> Money, fame, lifestyle</li>
                <li><strong>Social:</strong> Helping people, building community</li>
                <li><strong>Personal:</strong> Creative expression, skill development</li>
                <li><strong>Core:</strong> Identity, meaning, legacy</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Finding Your Deeper Why</h2>
            <p>Ask yourself these questions honestly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What change do I want to create in viewers' lives?</li>
                <li>What would I create even if no one paid me?</li>
                <li>What message do I feel compelled to share?</li>
                <li>Who am I trying to help, and why them specifically?</li>
                <li>What does this work mean for my own growth?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The answers don't need to be grand. "I want to help people learn to cook simple meals" is a perfectly valid purpose. What matters is that it's genuine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <h4>Common Mistake: Chasing Someone Else's Why</h4>
            <p>You see a creator talking about "building generational wealth" or "changing the world" and think your why needs to sound as impressive. It doesn't. Borrowed motivations don't fuel you when it's 2 AM and you're editing a video that might flop.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Purpose as a Filter</h2>
            <p>Once you're clear on your why, it becomes a decision-making filter:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content ideas:</strong> Does this serve my purpose?</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration offers:</strong> Does this align with my values?</li>
                <li><strong>Growth strategies:</strong> Does this attract the right audience?</li>
                <li><strong>Monetization:</strong> Does this serve my community or exploit them?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A clear purpose makes decisions easier and keeps you from chasing every trend.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pro-tip">
            <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
            <p>Write your "why" down and put it somewhere you'll see it daily. When the algorithm seems unfair or a video underperforms, reading it reminds you why you started.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-step">
            <h4>Action Steps</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Write down your initial reasons for wanting to create content</li>
                <li>For each reason, ask "why does that matter to me?" — go 5 levels deep</li>
                <li>Identify which motivations are external vs. internal</li>
                <li>Craft a one-sentence purpose statement and post it in your workspace</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Surface motivations (money, fame) aren't enough to sustain you</li>
                <li>Your "why" needs to survive the inevitable difficult periods</li>
