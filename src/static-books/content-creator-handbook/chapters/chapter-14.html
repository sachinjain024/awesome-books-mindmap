            <div class="insight-text">"The quality vs. quantity debate has no universal answer. The right balance depends on where you are in your journey, what niche you're in, and what you're optimizing for."</div>

            <h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
            <p>Quality and quantity aren't opposites — they're variables you can optimize together over time. Early on, quantity builds skill. Later, quality captures attention. The best creators eventually do both.</p>
            <p>The real question isn't "quality or quantity?" It's "what balance serves my current goals?"</p>

            <h2>When Quantity Wins</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You're new:</strong> You need reps to develop skill and find your voice</li>
                <li><strong>You're testing:</strong> More videos = more data on what works</li>
                <li><strong>Your niche is fast-moving:</strong> News, commentary, trends reward speed</li>
                <li><strong>You're building a library:</strong> SEO plays favor content volume</li>
                <li><strong>Your format is simple:</strong> Talking head videos don't need cinematic production</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When Quality Wins</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your niche is competitive:</strong> You need to stand out</li>
                <li><strong>Your format demands it:</strong> Documentaries, tutorials, reviews</li>
                <li><strong>You have an audience:</strong> They expect a certain standard</li>
                <li><strong>You're optimizing for brand:</strong> Quality content gets shared</li>
                <li><strong>You're playing evergreen:</strong> Timeless content should be polished</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <h4>Common Mistake: Quality Perfectionism Early On</h4>
            <p>New creators often spend 40 hours on a video to make it "perfect." The opportunity cost is enormous — those hours could have made 5 videos, each one teaching you more. Perfect is the enemy of published, especially when you're still developing your craft.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Defining "Quality"</h2>
            <p>Quality isn't just production value. True quality includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content quality:</strong> Is the information valuable, accurate, insightful?</li>
                <li><strong>Presentation quality:</strong> Is it engaging, clear, well-paced?</li>
                <li><strong>Production quality:</strong> Audio, video, editing — technical execution</li>
                <li><strong>Packaging quality:</strong> Thumbnail, title, description — first impressions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can have excellent content with modest production value. But you can't have poor content with great production and expect long-term success.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pro-tip">
            <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
            <p>Apply the 80/20 rule. Identify the 20% of effort that creates 80% of quality perception. Often it's lighting, audio, and pacing — not expensive cameras or elaborate editing. Master those first.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-step">
            <h4>Action Steps</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Honestly assess your current stage and what balance fits</li>
                <li>Set a maximum time per video to prevent perfectionism</li>
                <li>Identify the 3 quality factors that matter most in your niche</li>
                <li>Review your best-performing videos: what quality level did they have?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
