            <h2>The Camera Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>Understanding camera options helps you make smart decisions at each budget level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smartphone:</strong> Free (you already have one), 4K capable, good for starting</li>
                <li><strong>Webcam:</strong> ₹5,000-15,000, convenient for streams and simple talking head</li>
                <li><strong>Action cam:</strong> ₹15,000-40,000, great for dynamic, POV content</li>
                <li><strong>Mirrorless/DSLR:</strong> ₹50,000+, professional quality, learning curve</li>
                <li><strong>Cinema camera:</strong> ₹2,00,000+, high-end productions</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-box">
            <h3>When to Upgrade</h3>
            <p>Upgrade your camera when you can specifically identify what you're missing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low-light performance is limiting your shooting locations</li>
                <li>You need specific features (slow motion, autofocus tracking)</li>
                <li>Your skills have outgrown your current gear</li>
                <li>You've maximized what lighting and audio can do</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you can't name the specific limitation, you probably don't need to upgrade.</p>

            <h2>Smartphone Filming Tips</h2>
            <p>If you're starting with a phone, maximize its potential:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use the rear camera:</strong> Better quality than front-facing</li>
                <li><strong>Lock focus and exposure:</strong> Tap and hold to prevent shifts</li>
                <li><strong>Film in 4K:</strong> Even if you export 1080p, this gives flexibility</li>
                <li><strong>Use a tripod:</strong> Handheld looks amateur</li>
                <li><strong>Clean the lens:</strong> Fingerprints kill sharpness</li>
                <li><strong>Film horizontally:</strong> YouTube is a horizontal platform</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <h4>Common Mistake: The Gear Trap</h4>
            <p>New creators often buy expensive cameras hoping it will make their content better. But viewers care about content quality, not production quality. A ₹1,00,000 camera filming boring content is worse than a smartphone filming engaging content. Invest in gear after you've proven you can create engaging content with what you have.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pro-tip">
            <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
            <p>Rent before you buy. When you think you need a specific camera, rent it for a week. You'll learn whether it actually solves your problem — and you might discover you needed a different solution entirely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-step">
            <h4>Action Steps</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Assess what camera you currently have and learn its full capabilities</li>
                <li>Identify your specific camera limitations (if any) — be precise</li>
                <li>If upgrading, research the exact features you need and nothing more</li>
                <li>Master your current camera before buying the next one</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your smartphone is good enough to start — don't let gear be an excuse</li>
                <li>Upgrade only when you can identify specific limitations</li>
                <li>Key specs: resolution, frame rate, autofocus, flip screen</li>
                <li>Content quality matters more than camera quality</li>
                <li>Rent before buying to test if it solves your actual problem</li>
