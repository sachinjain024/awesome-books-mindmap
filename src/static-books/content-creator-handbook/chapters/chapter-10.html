            <h2>Your Niche is a Market</h2>
            <p>Think of your niche as an economic market. There are suppliers (creators) and demanders (viewers). When supply outstrips demand, competition intensifies and everyone struggles. When demand outstrips supply, opportunities abound.</p>
            <p>Your job is to find the pockets where demand exceeds supply.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Market Analysis Framework</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market size:</strong> How many people care about this topic?</li>
                <li><strong>Competition density:</strong> How many quality creators already serve this market?</li>
                <li><strong>Growth trajectory:</strong> Is interest increasing or declining?</li>
                <li><strong>Monetization potential:</strong> Will this audience support a business?</li>
                <li><strong>Entry barriers:</strong> What does it take to compete credibly?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Finding Blue Oceans</h2>
            <p>Red oceans are saturated markets where everyone competes for the same audience. Blue oceans are underserved spaces where you can thrive. Blue oceans appear as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intersection niches:</strong> Fitness + Gaming, Finance + Gen Z, Tech + Seniors</li>
                <li><strong>Underserved formats:</strong> A topic well-covered in blogs but not video</li>
                <li><strong>Geographic arbitrage:</strong> Topics popular globally but under-covered in your language</li>
                <li><strong>Depth opportunities:</strong> Surface-level coverage exists but no one goes deep</li>
                <li><strong>Emerging topics:</strong> New technologies, trends, or interests before they're saturated</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>Study your top 10 competitors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content:</strong> What topics do they cover? What formats?</li>
                <li><strong>Quality:</strong> How good is their production? Their research?</li>
                <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> What's their unique angle?</li>
                <li><strong>Gaps:</strong> What do their audiences ask for that they don't provide?</li>
                <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Where do they underdeliver?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your opportunity lies in competitors' gaps and weaknesses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="common-mistake">
            <h4>Common Mistake: Copying Market Leaders</h4>
            <p>Trying to be a "better version" of an established creator rarely works. They have brand recognition, audience loyalty, and algorithmic history you can't replicate. Instead, find the angle they're not covering — the audience they're not serving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Positioning Strategy</h2>
            <p>Positioning is the answer to "Why should someone choose you over alternatives?" Strong positioning comes from being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The only:</strong> "The only channel that covers X"</li>
                <li><strong>The best:</strong> "The highest quality content on X"</li>
                <li><strong>The first:</strong> "The first to cover emerging topic X"</li>
                <li><strong>The different:</strong> "X topic, but with Y angle/format"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>"Better" is weak positioning. "Different" is strong positioning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pro-tip">
            <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
            <p>Use YouTube Search + autocomplete to find demand. Type your topic and see what questions people are asking. High search volume + low quality results = opportunity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="action-step">
            <h4>Action Steps</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>List the top 10 creators in your niche and analyze their positioning</li>
                <li>Identify 3 gaps: topics they don't cover, audiences they don't serve, formats they don't use</li>
                <li>Research search volume for potential topics using YouTube suggestions</li>
                <li>Write your positioning statement: "I am the [only/first/best] ___"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
