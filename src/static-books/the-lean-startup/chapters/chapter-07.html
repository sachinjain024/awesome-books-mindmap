        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Two: Steer</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>How do you measure progress when you don't know what will work? Traditional accounting doesn't work for startups—you can't measure ROI on experiments or calculate the NPV of validated learning. This chapter introduces Innovation Accounting: a new way to measure whether your startup is making real progress.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Traditional Metrics Fail</h2>
            <p>Standard business metrics assume a stable, predictable environment. Revenue, profit margins, and market share matter when you know your business model works. But startups don't know if their model works—that's what they're trying to learn.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Danger of Vanity Metrics</h4>
                <p>Vanity metrics make you feel good but don't help you make decisions. Total users, page views, and raw revenue can all go up while your business is actually failing. They tell you what happened but not why or what to do about it.</p>
            </div>

            <p>A startup needs metrics that help it decide what to do next. Should we pivot or persevere? Is this feature worth the investment? Are we getting closer to product-market fit?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Innovation Accounting</h2>
            <p>Innovation accounting is a three-step process for measuring startup progress:</p>

            <div class="methodology-box">
                <h4>The Three Steps of Innovation Accounting</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Establish the baseline:</strong> Use an MVP to establish real data on where the company stands right now</li>
                    <li><strong>Tune the engine:</strong> Make changes and experiments to move the metrics from the baseline toward the ideal</li>
                    <li><strong>Pivot or persevere:</strong> Evaluate whether you're making sufficient progress toward the ideal, or need to change direction</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>This creates a clear framework for measuring progress: start with current reality, set a target, run experiments to improve metrics, and make a decision based on results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Actionable vs. Vanity Metrics</h2>
            <p>The key distinction is between metrics that help you make decisions (actionable) and metrics that just make you feel good (vanity).</p>

            <table class="comparison-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Vanity Metrics</th>
                    <th>Actionable Metrics</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Total registered users</td>
                    <td>Active users per week</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Total page views</td>
                    <td>Conversion rate from visit to signup</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Total revenue (cumulative)</td>
                    <td>Revenue per customer</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Number of downloads</td>
                    <td>Retention rate after 30 days</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Press mentions</td>
                    <td>Customer acquisition cost</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>A good metric is one that helps you decide what to do next. If a metric goes up or down and you wouldn't change your actions, it's probably a vanity metric.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Cohort Analysis</h2>
            <p>One of the most powerful tools for actionable metrics is cohort analysis: grouping customers by when they joined and tracking their behavior over time.</p>

            <div class="framework-box">
                <h4>How Cohort Analysis Works</h4>
                <p>Instead of looking at total users, segment users by when they signed up:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>January cohort:</strong> Users who joined in January</li>
                    <li><strong>February cohort:</strong> Users who joined in February</li>
                    <li><strong>Etc.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then track each cohort's behavior: retention, conversion, revenue. This reveals whether your product is improving for new users or if vanity metrics are masking problems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Case Study: Grockit's Cohort Analysis</h4>
                <p><span class="company">Grockit</span>, an online learning company, used cohort analysis to discover that their "improvements" weren't actually helping. New features increased total usage but didn't improve retention rates for new cohorts. This led them to rethink their approach entirely.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Split Testing (A/B Testing)</h2>
            <p>Split testing is essential for understanding cause and effect. Without it, you don't know if changes in metrics are due to your actions or external factors.</p>

            <div class="process-steps">
                <h4>Running a Split Test</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Formulate a clear hypothesis about what will improve metrics</li>
                    <li>Create two versions: control (current) and treatment (new)</li>
                    <li>Randomly assign users to each version</li>
                    <li>Measure the difference in key metrics</li>
                    <li>Make decisions based on statistical significance</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
