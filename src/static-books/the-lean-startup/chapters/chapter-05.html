        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Two: Steer</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Every business plan contains assumptions—guesses about what will make the business work. This chapter introduces the concept of leap-of-faith assumptions: the most critical hypotheses that determine whether your startup will succeed or fail. Identifying and testing these assumptions is essential before investing heavily.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Leap-of-Faith Assumptions</h2>
            <p>Every startup's business plan contains assumptions that are taken on faith. These aren't minor details—they're fundamental beliefs about how the world works that underlie the entire venture.</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <div class="term">Leap-of-Faith Assumptions</div>
                <div class="meaning">The riskiest elements of a startup's plan—the things that must be true for the business to work but that haven't been proven yet. They're called "leap of faith" because entrepreneurs bet everything on them.</div>
            </div>

            <p>The danger is that entrepreneurs often don't recognize their assumptions as assumptions. They treat beliefs as facts and build elaborate plans on unverified foundations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Two Most Critical Assumptions</h2>
            <p>While every business has many assumptions, Ries identifies two that are almost always the most important:</p>

            <div class="methodology-box">
                <h4>The Value Hypothesis</h4>
                <p>Tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="methodology-box">
                <h4>The Growth Hypothesis</h4>
                <p>Tests how new customers will discover a product or service. What's the mechanism for growth?</p>
            </div>

            <p>These two hypotheses are interrelated but distinct. A product can deliver value but have no growth mechanism, or grow rapidly but deliver little value (which leads to churn).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Facebook's Leap of Faith</h2>
            <p>Ries uses Facebook as an example of identifying and testing leap-of-faith assumptions.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Case Study: Facebook's Early Metrics</h4>
                <p><span class="company">Facebook</span> tracked whether users came back to the site day after day (value hypothesis) and whether they invited friends (growth hypothesis). Early data showed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>More than half of users came back every single day</li>
                    <li>At campuses where Facebook launched, the majority of students signed up within weeks</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These weren't vanity metrics—they demonstrated that the value and growth hypotheses were valid.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Facebook didn't need millions of users to validate their assumptions. The pattern of engagement and growth at individual campuses was enough to demonstrate the model worked.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Analogs and Antilogs</h2>
            <p>When identifying assumptions, look at what has worked before (analogs) and what has failed (antilogs). This helps clarify which assumptions are truly risky.</p>

            <div class="framework-box">
                <h4>Using Analogs and Antilogs</h4>
                <p><strong>Analog:</strong> A comparable company or product that proved something works. iPod's success showed people would pay for portable digital music (analog for iTunes).</p>
                <p><strong>Antilog:</strong> A failure that shows what doesn't work. Napster's legal troubles showed that illegal music distribution wasn't sustainable (antilog for iTunes).</p>
            </div>

            <p>Apple's iPod/iTunes strategy was built on learning from both: people want digital music (analog) but it needs to be legal (antilog).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Genchi Gembutsu</h2>
            <p>Ries borrows a concept from Toyota's manufacturing philosophy: genchi gembutsu, which translates to "go and see for yourself."</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "You cannot be sure you really understand any part of any business problem unless you go and see for yourself firsthand."
                <div class="attribution">— Toyota Principle</div>
            </div>

            <p>For startups, this means getting out of the building and observing real customers in their natural environment. You can't understand customer problems from behind a desk or through surveys alone.</p>

            <div class="process-steps">
                <h4>Applying Genchi Gembutsu</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify who your customer might be</li>
                    <li>Go to where they are (home, office, store)</li>
                    <li>Observe their behavior without interrupting</li>
                    <li>Ask open-ended questions about their problems</li>
                    <li>Look for behaviors that contradict what they say</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Getting Out of the Building</h2>
            <p>Steve Blank, one of the pioneers of the Lean Startup movement, famously said "Get out of the building." This complements genchi gembutsu.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Danger of Building in Isolation</h4>
                <p>Many entrepreneurs prefer building products to talking to customers. Building feels productive; customer conversations feel uncomfortable. But building without customer contact is the fastest path to building something nobody wants.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Customer development should happen in parallel with product development, not as an afterthought once the product is "ready."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Leap-of-faith assumptions are the riskiest elements of your plan that must be true for success</li>
                <li>The value hypothesis tests whether customers get value; the growth hypothesis tests how you'll acquire customers</li>
                <li>Use analogs (what worked) and antilogs (what failed) to clarify your assumptions</li>
                <li>Practice genchi gembutsu—go and see for yourself how customers behave</li>
                <li>Get out of the building early and often to understand real customer needs</li>
            </ul>
