        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: Define</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part One: Vision</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Before we can apply Lean Startup principles, we need a clear definition of what a startup actually is. Ries provides a surprisingly broad definition that extends far beyond Silicon Valley garages to include anyone working under conditions of extreme uncertainty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>A New Definition of Startup</h2>
            <p>Most people think of startups as young companies with a small number of employees. But Ries argues that size and age are not the defining characteristics. What makes something a startup is the context in which it operates.</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <div class="term">Startup</div>
                <div class="meaning">A human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.</div>
            </div>

            <p>This definition has several important implications:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Human institution:</strong> A startup involves people working together within a structure, which requires management</li>
                <li><strong>Designed to create:</strong> The goal is bringing something new into existence, not just running an existing operation</li>
                <li><strong>New product or service:</strong> There must be genuine innovation, not just copying what already exists</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme uncertainty:</strong> The outcome is unknown; you can't predict with confidence what will work</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Intrapreneurs Are Entrepreneurs Too</h2>
            <p>One of the most important insights is that this definition includes entrepreneurs within large companies—intrapreneurs. A team inside a Fortune 500 company launching a new product line faces the same uncertainty as founders in a garage.</p>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Case Study: Intuit's Internal Startups</h4>
                <p><span class="company">Intuit</span>, the maker of TurboTax and QuickBooks, applies Lean Startup principles to internal teams developing new products. These teams operate like startups within the corporation, using MVPs and validated learning to test new ideas before major investment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>The context matters more than the setting. Whether you're in a garage or a corporate office, if you're creating something new under uncertainty, you're doing startup work and need startup methods.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Snaptax Story</h2>
            <p>Ries shares the story of SnapTax, a mobile app developed within Intuit that allowed users to file taxes by taking a photo of their W-2 form. Despite being developed inside a large corporation, the team used Lean Startup principles.</p>

            <div class="framework-box">
                <h4>How SnapTax Applied Lean Thinking</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Started with a small team operating with startup-like autonomy</li>
                    <li>Released early versions to learn what customers actually needed</li>
                    <li>Iterated rapidly based on real user feedback</li>
                    <li>Measured success by learning, not just traditional metrics</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>SnapTax became one of Intuit's most successful new products, demonstrating that Lean Startup thinking works in corporate environments when given proper support.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What a Startup Is Not</h2>
            <p>Understanding what doesn't qualify as a startup helps clarify the definition:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Not just small businesses:</strong> A new restaurant using a proven business model isn't a startup—the outcome is relatively predictable</li>
                <li><strong>Not defined by industry:</strong> Startups can exist in any sector, not just technology</li>
                <li><strong>Not defined by funding:</strong> Bootstrapped and venture-backed companies can both be startups</li>
                <li><strong>Not defined by legal structure:</strong> A startup can be a nonprofit, government agency, or corporation</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "If you are building a new venture—whether in the garage of a new company or inside a large established company—you are a startup."
                <div class="attribution">— Eric Ries</div>

        <div class="key-points">
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A startup is defined by uncertainty, not by size, age, or industry</li>
                <li>Intrapreneurs inside large companies can be entrepreneurs facing the same challenges</li>
                <li>The defining characteristic is creating something new under conditions where the outcome is unknown</li>
                <li>This broad definition means Lean Startup principles apply widely across contexts</li>
            </ul>
