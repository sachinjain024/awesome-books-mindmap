        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Three: Accelerate</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Where does growth come from? This chapter introduces the three engines of growth: sticky, viral, and paid. Understanding which engine powers your startup is essential for making good decisions about where to invest resources. Trying to optimize all three at once usually means optimizing none.</p>

            <h2>Sustainable Growth</h2>
            <p>Not all growth is created equal. Sustainable growth comes from the actions of past customers, not from one-time events.</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <div class="term">Sustainable Growth</div>
                <div class="meaning">Growth that comes from the actions of past customers: word of mouth, side effects of product usage, funded advertising (from revenue), or repeat purchases. One-time campaigns or PR bursts are not sustainable growth.</div>
            </div>

            <p>Sustainable growth follows a simple rule: new customers come from the actions of past customers. This happens in four ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Word of mouth:</strong> Satisfied customers tell others</li>
                <li><strong>Side effect of usage:</strong> Seeing others use the product (fashion, status symbols)</li>
                <li><strong>Funded advertising:</strong> Revenue from customers funds ads that bring new customers</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat purchase:</strong> Products that need replenishment or subscription renewals</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Three Engines of Growth</h2>
            <p>Ries identifies three engines that power startup growth. Most successful startups focus on one engine at a time.</p>

            <div class="methodology-box">
                <h4>Engine 1: The Sticky Engine</h4>
                <p>Focus: <strong>Retention</strong></p>
                <p>Growth comes from keeping existing customers. The key metric is churn rate—the percentage of customers who stop using the product. If you acquire more customers than you lose, you grow.</p>
                <div class="metric-box" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    <h4>The Sticky Growth Formula</h4>
                    <p><strong>Growth Rate = New Customer Acquisition Rate - Churn Rate</strong></p>
                    <p>If your churn is 5% per month and you add 10% new customers, you grow 5% per month.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="methodology-box">
                <h4>Engine 2: The Viral Engine</h4>
                <p>Focus: <strong>Customer-driven spread</strong></p>
                <p>Growth comes from customers spreading the product to others as a natural part of usage. Think Hotmail's "Get your free email at Hotmail" signature, or Facebook's friend invitations.</p>
                <div class="metric-box" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    <h4>The Viral Coefficient</h4>
                    <p><strong>Viral Coefficient = Number of new customers each existing customer brings</strong></p>
                    <p>If each customer brings in 1.1 new customers, you have exponential growth. If it's 0.9, growth will eventually stall.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="methodology-box">
                <h4>Engine 3: The Paid Engine</h4>
                <p>Focus: <strong>Customer acquisition through advertising</strong></p>
                <p>Growth comes from paying to acquire customers and making more money from them than you spent. The math must work: revenue per customer must exceed cost to acquire.</p>
                <div class="metric-box" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    <h4>The Paid Growth Formula</h4>
                    <p><strong>Sustainable if: Lifetime Value (LTV) > Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</strong></p>
                    <p>The bigger the gap between LTV and CAC, the faster you can grow by reinvesting the margin.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Choosing Your Engine</h2>
            <p>A common mistake is trying to optimize all three engines simultaneously. This spreads resources too thin and makes it hard to know what's working.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Successful startups usually focus on one engine of growth. Only after mastering one do they consider adding another. Trying to be viral AND sticky AND paid usually means being none of them effectively.</p>
            </div>

            <table class="comparison-table">

            </table>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When Engines Run Out</h2>
            <p>Every engine of growth eventually runs out of steam. Markets become saturated, competition increases, or customer behavior changes.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Signs Your Engine Is Stalling</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Growth rate declining despite increased investment</li>
                    <li>CAC rising while LTV stays flat (paid engine)</li>
                    <li>Churn rate increasing (sticky engine)</li>
                    <li>Viral coefficient dropping below 1 (viral engine)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>When an engine runs out, you need to pivot to a new engine or find ways to revitalize the current one. This is why successful companies eventually diversify their growth strategies—but only after mastering the first one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Product/Market Fit</h2>
            <p>Before focusing on engines of growth, you need product/market fit—the point where customers demonstrate they want your product through their behavior, not just their words.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The engine of growth determines product/market fit. Startups that are tuned in to the right engine of growth can find product/market fit faster."

                <h4>Signs of Product/Market Fit</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customers are buying as fast as you can produce</li>
                    <li>Usage and engagement metrics are strong</li>
                    <li>Word of mouth is driving significant growth</li>
                    <li>You're scrambling to scale, not struggling to get users</li>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                <li>Sustainable growth comes from the actions of past customers</li>
                <li>Three engines of growth: sticky (retention), viral (spread), and paid (advertising)</li>
                <li>Focus on one engine at a time—trying to optimize all three spreads you too thin</li>
                <li>Each engine has a key metric: churn rate, viral coefficient, or LTV vs CAC</li>
                <li>Engines eventually run out—be prepared to pivot to a new growth strategy</li>
                <li>Product/market fit must come before scaling your engine of growth</li>
