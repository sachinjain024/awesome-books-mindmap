        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: Feedback</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part One: Foundation</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Feedback is how people improve. Yet most organizations are bad at it—either avoiding hard conversations or delivering criticism in ways that trigger defensiveness. Mochary draws on the radical candor framework: care personally and challenge directly. This chapter covers how to give and receive feedback so it actually changes behavior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Feedback Fails</h2>
            <p>Feedback often fails because it's vague ("You need to be more proactive") or delayed (months later in a review). It can also be delivered without care, so the recipient feels attacked, or with so much cushion that the message is lost. Effective feedback is <strong>specific</strong>, <strong>timely</strong>, and delivered with <strong>care</strong> so the person can hear it and act on it.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Generic feedback doesn't change behavior. "You need to communicate better" is useless. "In the product review, when you didn't share the timeline until the end, the team was confused—next time lead with the timeline" is actionable.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Giving Feedback: Structure</h2>
            <p>Use a simple structure: <strong>Situation → Behavior → Impact</strong>. Describe the specific situation, the observable behavior, and the impact it had. Then invite a response. This keeps the feedback factual and focused on behavior, not character.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>Feedback Formula</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Situation:</strong> "In yesterday's standup when we were discussing the launch..."</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> "You said we'd ship by Friday without checking with engineering."</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact:</strong> "That created confusion and put the team in a bind when we couldn't meet that date."</li>
                    <li>Then: "What's your take?" or "How do you see it?"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Care Personally, Challenge Directly</h2>
            <p>Radical candor sits at the intersection of caring personally and challenging directly. If you challenge without care, you're obnoxious; if you care but don't challenge, you're not helping them grow. Show that you're on their side—then say the hard thing clearly. "I'm telling you this because I want you to succeed" is a powerful opener.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Care personally, challenge directly. If you don't care, your challenge feels like an attack. If you don't challenge, your care doesn't help them get better."

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Receiving Feedback</h2>
            <p>As CEO, you need to model receiving feedback. Thank the person for sharing, even if it's hard to hear. Ask for examples. Don't get defensive or explain away—listen first. If you disagree, you can say so after you've understood. Making it safe to give you feedback is one of the most important things you can do for the culture.</p>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Practice: End 1:1s with "Any feedback for me?"</h4>
                <p>Make it a habit to ask every direct report: "What feedback do you have for me?" or "What could I do differently to support you better?" Then listen, thank them, and if appropriate, share what you'll try to do differently.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Praise and Recognition</h2>
            <p>Positive feedback should also be specific and timely. "Great job" is nice but doesn't reinforce the right behavior. "The way you ran that customer call—you stayed calm, summarized their concerns, and committed to a follow-up—that's exactly how we want to handle escalations" tells them what to repeat.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Saving all feedback for the annual review. By then it's too late to change behavior, and the recipient feels blindsided. Give feedback in the moment or within days.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Feedback must be specific (Situation → Behavior → Impact), timely, and delivered with care.</li>
                <li>Care personally and challenge directly: show you're on their side, then say the hard thing.</li>
                <li>Ask for feedback on yourself regularly and receive it without defensiveness.</li>
                <li>Praise should be specific too—so people know what to repeat.</li>
                <li>Don't save feedback for the annual review; give it in the moment or within days.</li>
            </ul>
