        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 8: Firing and Letting People Go</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Three: People</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Letting someone go is one of the hardest things a leader does—and one of the most important. Keeping someone who isn't working out hurts the team, the company, and often the person. This chapter covers when to act, how to do it with clarity and compassion, and how to handle the aftermath for the team and the individual.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When to Let Someone Go</h2>
            <p>Act when it's clear the person isn't going to get to the bar: performance hasn't improved despite feedback and support, values are misaligned, or the role has outgrown them and there's no path. Don't wait for "enough" documentation if you already know—protracting the situation rarely helps. If you've given clear feedback, a timeline, and support, and they're still not there, it's time.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Waiting too long to fire is unfair to everyone: the person (who could be finding a better fit elsewhere), the team (who carries the load), and the company (which pays for underperformance). Once you know, act.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Do It With Clarity and Compassion</h2>
            <p>Be clear and direct. This isn't a negotiation—you're informing them of a decision that's already been made. State the reason simply (e.g., "We're not seeing the performance we need in this role" or "We've decided to go in a different direction"). Be kind: thank them for their contributions, and don't pile on or debate. Keep the meeting short. Have logistics ready: final pay, benefits, transition if any.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>Firing Conversation Structure</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>State the decision clearly and briefly</li>
                    <li>Give a simple, honest reason (no long list of failures)</li>
                    <li>Thank them for their work</li>
                    <li>Explain logistics: last day, pay, benefits, handover</li>
                    <li>Don't debate or negotiate; the decision is made</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Before the Conversation</h2>
            <p>Align with anyone who needs to know (HR, co-founders, legal if relevant). Have the logistics sorted: final paycheck, COBRA or benefits info, return of equipment. Plan what you'll tell the team—usually after the person has been informed, and with a consistent message that respects privacy while reducing rumor. The person should hear it from you first, not from a colleague.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Be clear, be kind, be brief. The person deserves to know why and what happens next. They don't deserve a long lecture or to be blindsided without feedback history."

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>After: Team and Individual</h2>
            <p>Tell the team in a way that doesn't violate the departed person's privacy but gives enough context to reduce anxiety. "X is no longer with the company. We're grateful for their contributions. Here's how we'll handle the transition." Don't badmouth. For the person leaving, offer what you can: reference policy, outplacement if you have it, and a clean exit so they can move on with dignity.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Firing without having given clear feedback first. If the person is surprised, you didn't do your job in 1:1s. They should have known where they stood and had a chance to improve.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Act when it's clear the person won't get to the bar; waiting hurts everyone.</li>
                <li>Be clear, direct, and compassionate; state the decision and reason simply.</li>
                <li>Prepare logistics (pay, benefits, handover) and align with HR/leadership before the conversation.</li>
                <li>Tell the team after, with a message that respects privacy and reduces rumor.</li>
                <li>Give clear feedback before firing—no one should be surprised on the day they're let go.</li>
            </ul>
