        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 12: Personal Productivity</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Four: Strategy & Governance</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>As CEO, your time and energy are the scarcest resources. If you're exhausted, reactive, or scattered, the company suffers. This chapter covers how to protect your focus, prioritize ruthlessly, delegate effectively, and avoid the traps that burn out founders.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Your Time Is the Constraint</h2>
            <p>You can't do everything. Every "yes" is a "no" to something else. The only way to scale your impact is to focus on the few things that only you can do and delegate or drop the rest. That means saying no to meetings that don't need you, to projects that others can own, and to the urge to jump into every fire.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>If it can be done by someone else without you, it should be. Your job is to do the things that only the CEO can do—and to make that list as short as possible by building the team and systems.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Prioritization</h2>
            <p>Use a simple framework: What's the one thing that, if done well, would make everything else easier or unnecessary? Focus there first. Rank by impact and urgency; do the high-impact work before the urgent-but-low-impact. Revisit priorities weekly so you're not drifting. Share your priorities with your team so they can align and take work off your plate.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>CEO Priority Check</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>What only I can do? (strategy, key hires, culture, board)</li>
                    <li>What's the highest impact right now?</li>
                    <li>What can I delegate or drop?</li>
                    <li>Am I in the right meetings or just in all of them?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Energy and Health</h2>
            <p>You can't pour from an empty cup. Sleep, exercise, and recovery aren't luxuries—they're what allow you to show up clearly for the team. Build non-negotiables into your schedule: block time for deep work, for 1:1s, and for yourself. If you're always on, you'll make worse decisions and model burnout for the company.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The company needs you at your best. That means protecting your energy and making choices that are sustainable, not heroic sprints that end in collapse."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Delegation and Letting Go</h2>
            <p>Delegation isn't dumping—it's transferring ownership with clarity. Define the outcome, the constraints, and how you'll check in. Then let the person run. Don't take it back at the first mistake; coach and course-correct. The more you delegate, the more you free yourself for CEO work and the more you develop the team.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Filling every gap yourself. If you're the only one who can do X, you've built a single point of failure. Train others, document, and delegate so the company doesn't depend on you for everything.</p>
