        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: Operating as a CEO</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part One: Foundation</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Before diving into tactics, Mochary grounds you in how to think about the CEO role. You are both the person with the most leverage and the biggest potential bottleneck. This chapter sets the mindset: your job is to build systems, remove yourself as the constraint, and scale the organization's output.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>You Are the Bottleneck</h2>
            <p>Every company has a limiting factor—the constraint that determines how much the organization can produce. Often, that constraint is the CEO. Decisions wait on you. Information flows through you. If you don't consciously design otherwise, you become the single point of failure and the cap on growth.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>The CEO's primary job is to <strong>remove themselves as the bottleneck</strong>. That means building systems (1:1s, OKRs, clear communication) so that the organization can function and scale without every thread running through you.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Leverage and Delegation</h2>
            <p>Your time is finite. The only way to multiply your impact is through leverage: doing things that cause many other people to do the right things. Delegation isn't dumping work—it's clearly transferring ownership so someone else can run with it while you focus on the highest-leverage activities: strategy, culture, hiring, and developing your leaders.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>High-Leverage CEO Activities</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Setting and communicating strategy</li>
                    <li>Hiring and developing your leadership team</li>
                    <li>Building culture and reinforcing values</li>
                    <li>Running effective 1:1s and giving feedback</li>
                    <li>Making the few decisions that only you can make</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Clarity of Role</h2>
            <p>As the company grows, your role must evolve. Early on you might be deep in product or sales; later you're orchestrating others who do that work. Confusion about "what the CEO should do" leads to either micromanagement or neglect. Define your role clearly: what only you can do, and what you must delegate.</p>

                "The goal is to make the company run so well that it could run without you—and then to choose to stay anyway because you add unique value."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Building Systems Over Heroics</h2>
            <p>Founders often pride themselves on jumping in to fix every fire. That works at five people; it breaks at fifty. The shift from hero to system-builder is essential. Document how things work, create repeatable processes, and train others to run them so the company doesn't depend on your personal intervention.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Staying in the weeds because it feels productive. You may be the best at that task, but if you're doing it, you're not doing what only the CEO can do—and you're teaching the team to depend on you instead of building capability.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your job is to remove yourself as the bottleneck by building systems and developing people.</li>
