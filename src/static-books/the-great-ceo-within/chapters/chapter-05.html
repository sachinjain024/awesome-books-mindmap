        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Two: Execution</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Meetings can be a lever for alignment and decisions—or a tax on everyone's time. This chapter covers how to structure team meetings, all-hands, and other recurring meetings so they have a clear purpose, an owner, and an agenda that makes them worth attending.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Types of Meetings</h2>
            <p>Different meetings serve different purposes. <strong>1:1s</strong> are for individual alignment and feedback. <strong>Team meetings</strong> are for the team to sync on priorities, blockers, and decisions. <strong>All-hands</strong> are for company-wide communication and culture. <strong>Project or decision meetings</strong> are for a specific outcome. Define the purpose of each meeting type and stick to it.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>Meeting Types at a Glance</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1:1:</strong> Report-driven; alignment, feedback, growth</li>
                    <li><strong>Team meeting:</strong> Priorities, blockers, decisions, team culture</li>
                    <li><strong>All-hands:</strong> Company updates, strategy, wins, Q&A</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision meeting:</strong> Single topic; decision by end</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Every Meeting Needs an Owner and Agenda</h2>
            <p>No meeting should exist without a clear owner (who runs it and is responsible for its effectiveness) and an agenda (what will be discussed and in what order). The owner sends the agenda in advance so people can prepare. If there's no agenda, consider canceling—or make the first agenda item "Why are we here?"</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>If you can't state the purpose of a meeting in one sentence, don't have it. "Sync" or "touch base" often means "we didn't plan"—replace with a clear purpose or async update.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Team Meetings</h2>
            <p>Team meetings (e.g., weekly with your direct reports or a cross-functional team) should cover: wins, priorities for the week, blockers, and decisions needed. Keep status updates short or async; use the live time for discussion and decisions. End with clear next steps and owners.</p>

            <div class="template-box">
                <h4>Team Meeting Agenda (example)</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wins / celebrations (2–5 min)</li>
                    <li>Priorities this week (each person 1–2 min)</li>
                    <li>Blockers and decisions (main discussion)</li>
                    <li>Action items and owners</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>All-Hands</h2>
            <p>All-hands are for the whole company. Use them to share strategy, key metrics, wins, and challenges. Include a Q&A so people can ask anything. Keep them regular (e.g., weekly or biweekly) and time-boxed. The CEO often runs or anchors them, but other leaders can present their areas. Transparency builds trust; sugar-coating or hiding problems erodes it.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The all-hands is where the company hears from you. Use it to be honest about where things stand—good and bad—and to reinforce what matters."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Making Meetings Effective</h2>
            <p>Start and end on time. Invite only who needs to be there. Leave time for discussion, not just presentation. Capture decisions and action items and share them afterward. If a meeting isn't working, change the format or kill it—don't let bad meetings become permanent.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Defaulting to a meeting when a document or async update would do. Ask: "Could this be a memo or a Slack update?" If yes, do that first and use meetings for the conversations that need to happen live.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Define the purpose of each meeting type; don't mix 1:1, team, and all-hands into one blob.</li>
                <li>Every meeting has an owner and an agenda sent in advance.</li>
                <li>Team meetings: wins, priorities, blockers, decisions—keep status minimal.</li>
                <li>All-hands: strategy, metrics, wins, challenges, Q&A—be transparent.</li>
                <li>Default to async when possible; use meetings for discussion and decisions that need to happen live.</li>
            </ul>
