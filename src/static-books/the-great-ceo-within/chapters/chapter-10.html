        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Four: Strategy & Governance</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Strategy is where you're going and why. Without it, the team executes in different directions. With it, everyone can make decisions that align. This chapter covers how to set direction, make strategic choices, and communicate strategy so the organization can run with it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Strategy Is</h2>
            <p>Strategy is the set of choices that define how you'll win: which customers, which problems, which solutions, and how you'll deliver value in a way others can't easily copy. It's not a long document—it's a clear direction and a few key bets. Good strategy answers: Where are we going? Why there? What are we not doing?</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Strategy is choice. Saying yes to one path means saying no to others. If you're trying to do everything, you don't have a strategy—you have a wish list.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Setting Direction</h2>
            <p>Start with the outcome you want: revenue, market position, impact. Then work backward: what must be true for that to happen? What are the 2–4 key bets or initiatives? Get input from the team and board, but own the synthesis. The CEO's job is to set direction and make the calls when there's conflict or ambiguity.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>Strategy Elements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vision or outcome (where we're going)</li>
                    <li>Key bets or initiatives (what we're doing to get there)</li>
                    <li>What we're not doing (explicit no's)</li>
                    <li>How we'll know we're on track (metrics, OKRs)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Communicating Strategy</h2>
            <p>Once you have strategy, communicate it repeatedly. In all-hands, in 1:1s, in written updates. People forget; repetition builds retention. Connect daily work to strategy: "This project matters because it's one of our key bets." If someone can't explain the strategy, you haven't communicated enough or clearly enough.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "If your team can't repeat the strategy back to you, they don't know it. And if they don't know it, they can't execute toward it."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Revisiting Strategy</h2>
            <p>Strategy isn't set once and frozen. Revisit when you hit major milestones, when the market shifts, or when execution isn't working. Be willing to pivot or adjust—but don't flip-flop every week. Change when the evidence says so, and communicate why you're changing so the team can follow.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Keeping strategy in the CEO's head or in a deck no one reads. Write it down, share it, and refer to it in decisions and updates so it's alive.</p>
