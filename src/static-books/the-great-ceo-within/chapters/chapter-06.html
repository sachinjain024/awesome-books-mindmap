        <div class="chapter-meta">Part Two: Execution</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Spoken communication doesn't scale. As the company grows, you can't repeat the same message in every meeting. Writing scales: one memo or update reaches everyone, can be referenced later, and forces clarity of thought. This chapter covers why and how to use written communication as a core operating tool.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Writing Scales</h2>
            <p>When you say something in a meeting, only the people in the room hear it—and they may remember it differently. When you write it down, everyone can read it, anytime. Writing also forces you to think clearly: fuzzy ideas don't survive the transition to sentences. For strategy, decisions, and context, writing is the leverage that lets you scale your communication.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>If you have to say the same thing in 10 meetings, you should have written it once and shared it. Use writing for anything that needs to reach more than a few people or persist as reference.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What to Write</h2>
            <p>Common written artifacts: <strong>Strategy memos</strong> (where we're going and why), <strong>decision memos</strong> (what we decided and the reasoning), <strong>weekly or monthly updates</strong> (progress, metrics, priorities), and <strong>post-mortems or learnings</strong> (what happened and what we'll do differently). Not everything needs a long doc—sometimes a short update in Slack or email is enough. Match the format to the audience and the stakes.</p>

            <div class="technique-box">
                <h4>When to Write vs. Meet</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Write:</strong> Strategy, decisions, context, updates that many people need</li>
                    <li><strong>Meet:</strong> Discussion, debate, feedback, relationship-building, complex decisions that need back-and-forth</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Updates: Cadence and Content</h2>
            <p>Regular updates (e.g., weekly from the CEO or each team lead) keep the company aligned. Include: key metrics, wins, challenges, and priorities. Keep them scannable: bullets, short paragraphs, clear headers. Consistency matters—if you skip weeks, people stop reading. Share in a central place (email, Slack, Notion, etc.) so everyone knows where to find them.</p>

            <div class="template-box">
                <h4>Weekly Update Structure (example)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> 2–5 key numbers and trend</li>
                    <li><strong>Wins:</strong> What went well</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> What's hard or at risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Priorities next week:</strong> What we're focusing on</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Clarity and Brevity</h2>
            <p>Good writing is clear and concise. Lead with the main point. Use short sentences and paragraphs. Avoid jargon unless the audience shares it. If a section doesn't add value, cut it. The goal is to be understood quickly—respect the reader's time.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Write so that the busiest person in the company can understand you in one pass. If they have to read it twice, you didn't do your job."

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Common Mistake</h4>
                <p>Relying on meetings to communicate important decisions or strategy, then wondering why people are misaligned. Write the strategy and key decisions down; use meetings to discuss and refine, not to replace the document.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Writing scales; speaking doesn't. Use memos and updates for strategy, decisions, and context.</li>
                <li>Write strategy memos, decision memos, and regular updates (weekly/monthly) so everyone has a single source of truth.</li>
                <li>Keep updates scannable: metrics, wins, challenges, priorities.</li>
                <li>Be clear and concise; lead with the main point and respect the reader's time.</li>
            </ul>
