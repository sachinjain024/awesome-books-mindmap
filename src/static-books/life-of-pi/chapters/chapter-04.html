        <div class="chapter-meta">Life of Pi</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Pi and Richard Parker reach a floating island covered with meerkats and fresh water. At night the island turns lethal—the water is acidic, the plants carnivorous. Pi realizes it is a false paradise. He leaves and drifts until the boat washes up in Mexico.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>False Paradise</h2>
            <p>The island offers food, water, and rest. For a time Pi and Richard Parker recover. But Pi discovers that the island consumes life—at night the ponds become acidic. The island is a metaphor for giving up: comfortable but deadly. To stay would be to stop striving, to be consumed. He chooses the boat and the open sea again.</p>

            <h4>Key Insight</h4>
            <p>Sometimes safety is an illusion that would cost us our humanity or our purpose. Pi chooses the risk of the ocean over the false security of the island.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Not every refuge is a real haven—some comforts hide destruction.</li>
                <li>Choosing to leave "safety" for the unknown can be the right choice.</li>
                <li>Pi's will to find "his own kind" keeps him moving toward life.</li>
