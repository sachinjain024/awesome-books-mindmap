                <h3>Core Teachings of The Alchemist</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Legend</strong> — Your true purpose in life; when you pursue it, the universe supports you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Omens</strong> — The language of the universe; learn to read signs and follow them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fear of failure</strong> — Often worse than failure itself; it keeps you from even trying.</li>
                    <li><strong>The present moment</strong> — Life is the moment we're living now; don't live in fear of loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen to your heart</strong> — It knows your dreams and speaks the language of the Soul of the World.</li>
                </ul>
