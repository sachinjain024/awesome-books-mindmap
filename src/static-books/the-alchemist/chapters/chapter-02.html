        <div class="chapter-meta">The Journey</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>In Tarifa, Santiago meets Melchizedek, the King of Salem, who introduces him to the idea of Personal Legend and the importance of following it. Santiago decides to sell his sheep and cross the sea to pursue his dream.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Melchizedek, King of Salem</h2>
            <p>Melchizedek appears as an old man who seems to know Santiago's story without being told. He explains that everyone has a Personal Legend—what they have always wanted to accomplish. When we're young we know it clearly; the world then convinces us it's impossible, and we forget.</p>

                "When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Urim and Thummim</h2>
            <p>Melchizedek gives Santiago two stones from his breastplate—Urim and Thummim—to help him read omens when he cannot interpret them himself. They represent "yes" and "no," a reminder that the universe speaks to those who pay attention.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Omens are the language of the universe. The stones are a symbol: we already have access to guidance when we choose to look and listen.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Selling the Sheep</h2>
            <p>Santiago sells his flock. Letting go of what he has—his security—is the first real test. He chooses the dream over comfort. With the money and the stones, he sets sail for Africa, where his journey will truly begin.</p>
