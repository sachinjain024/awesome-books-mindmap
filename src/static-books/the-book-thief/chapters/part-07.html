        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Speaks</h4>
            <p>"They came through Molching in a parade of misery. Pale as paper, thin as wire. They were Jews being marched to Dachau, and they passed right through the town's main street."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The March to Dachau</h2>
            <p>The concentration camp at Dachau is not far from Molching. Sometimes, the Jews are marched through town on their way there. The townspeople are expected to watch—to see what happens to enemies of the Reich.</p>
            <p>Liesel stands with the crowd. She sees the starving men shuffling past, their eyes empty. She thinks of Max in the basement, hiding, waiting, hoping to never join this parade.</p>
            <p>And then she sees Hans do something that will change everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tragedy-box">
            <h4>Hans's Compassion</h4>
            <p>An old Jewish man falls in the street. He cannot get up. The soldiers are screaming. The crowd is watching.</p>
            <p>Hans Hubermann steps forward with a piece of bread.</p>
            <p>He gives it to the old man. Helps him stand. In front of everyone—the soldiers, the neighbors, the children of Molching—Hans Hubermann shows kindness to a Jew.</p>
            <p>A soldier whips Hans across the face. Six times. Blood runs down his silver eyes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Consequences</h2>
            <p>Hans knows immediately what he has done. By showing compassion to a Jew, he has invited investigation. If they search his house, they will find Max.</p>
            <p>That night, Max must leave. There is no choice. He cannot stay and risk all their lives.</p>
            <p>The family that has become his home, the girl who brought him the weather, the basement where he painted words over hate—he must leave it all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Goodbye</h2>
            <p>Max leaves in darkness. He and Liesel have only moments together. There is too much to say and no time to say it.</p>
            <p>Max gives Liesel his notebook—the one where he's been working on The Word Shaker. It is not finished, but it is everything he has.</p>
            <p>Liesel watches him disappear into the night. She does not know if she will ever see him again.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Reflects</h4>
            <p>"Hans Hubermann's mistake was not kindness. Kindness is never a mistake. His mistake was being kind in public, in Nazi Germany, where kindness to Jews was a crime punishable by death."</p>
            <p>"Some people think courage is the absence of fear. It isn't. Courage is being afraid and doing it anyway. Hans was terrified as he stepped forward with that bread. He did it anyway."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Wait</h2>
            <p>Hans waits for the knock on the door. For the Gestapo to come. For his family to be taken.</p>
            <p>But the knock doesn't come—at least not in the way he expected. Instead, Hans receives draft papers. He is being sent to serve in a dangerous unit, cleaning up after air raids. It is a punishment, but not the worst punishment.</p>
            <p>Rosa does not cry when he leaves. She tells him to come back. She calls him Saukerl one last time, her voice breaking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stolen-book">
            <h4>The Complete Duden Dictionary and Thesaurus</h4>
            <p>Before the disaster, before the parade, Ilsa Hermann gave Liesel a gift: <strong>The Complete Duden Dictionary and Thesaurus</strong>. Not stolen through a window, but given freely.</p>
            <p>It is a book containing all words. Every word in the German language, with definitions. It is the ultimate gift from a woman who understands Liesel's hunger.</p>
            <p>With this book, Liesel can find any word she needs. She will need them all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Alone</h2>
            <p>Hans is gone. Max is gone. Liesel and Rosa are alone on Himmel Street.</p>
            <p>Liesel throws herself into books and words, trying to fill the empty spaces. She reads to Frau Holtzapfel. She climbs through the mayor's window. She writes in Max's notebook, continuing the story he started.</p>
            <p>She begins to write her own book. She calls it The Book Thief.</p>
        </div>
