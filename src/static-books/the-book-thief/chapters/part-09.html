            <h4>Death Speaks</h4>
            <p>"The war was closing in on all sides. I was busy in those days—so many souls to collect, so many colors of sky to record. But I still watched Himmel Street. I knew what was coming."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Changing War</h2>
            <p>Germany is losing. The news doesn't say so—the news never says so—but everyone knows. The air raids come more frequently. The rations grow smaller. Young men disappear and don't return.</p>
            <p>Hans Hubermann serves in a unit that cleans up after bombings. He is still alive, but barely. His letters home grow shorter.</p>
            <p>Liesel and Rosa wait. Everyone waits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Plane Crash</h2>
            <p>An Allied plane crashes near Molching. It falls from the sky like a broken bird, trailing smoke and fire. The townspeople rush to see.</p>
            <p>Liesel and Rudy arrive before the soldiers. Inside the wreckage, they find the pilot—a young man, barely older than them, dying in the German fields.</p>
            <p>Rudy reaches in and takes a small stuffed bear from the pilot's jacket. He places it in the dying man's hands.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Collects</h4>
            <p>"I collected the pilot's soul while two German children watched. The boy with lemon hair gave him a teddy bear. The girl stood silent, her hand on her friend's shoulder."</p>
            <p>"This is what war does: it puts children in fields with dying enemies. It asks them to decide who deserves comfort."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Rudy's Struggles</h2>
            <p>Rudy has been targeted by Nazi officials who want to send him to a special school for elite German youth. His father refuses, risking everything to keep his son home.</p>
            <p>But Rudy is changing. The boy who painted himself black to be Jesse Owens is growing into a young man who questions everything. He gives teddy bears to enemy pilots. He steals food for his hungry family. He loves a book thief with all his heart.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="character-box">
            <h4>Rudy Steiner</h4>
            <div class="role">The Boy Who Loved Liesel</div>
            <p>He has asked for one kiss. Just one. He has asked a thousand times, in a thousand ways. Liesel always refuses, laughing, pushing him away.</p>
            <p>She does not know—cannot know—that she is running out of time to say yes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hans Returns</h2>
            <p>A miracle: Hans Hubermann comes home. His unit was decimated, but he survived. He returns thinner, older, his silver eyes dimmed by what he has seen.</p>
            <p>Rosa doesn't cry. She holds him at the door. She calls him Saukerl. Her voice does not break.</p>
            <p>Liesel clings to him like he might disappear. He promises: he is home. He will stay.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Last Days</h2>
            <p>The war is nearly over, but the bombing continues. Molching waits. Himmel Street waits. Every night, the sirens might sound. Every night might be the last.</p>
            <p>Liesel writes in the basement. Her book is almost finished. She writes about everyone she loves: Hans with his accordion, Rosa with her rough love, Rudy with his lemon hair and endless requests for kisses, Max wherever he is.</p>
            <p>She does not know she is writing their epitaphs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tragedy-box">
            <h4>Foreshadowing</h4>
            <p>Death tells us what is coming. He has told us from the beginning. He has warned us that he saw Liesel three times.</p>
            <p>The third time, the sky was red.</p>
        </div>
