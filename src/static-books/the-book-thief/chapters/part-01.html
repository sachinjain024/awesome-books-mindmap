            <h4>Death Speaks</h4>
            <p>"First the colors. Then the humans. That's usually how I see things. Or at least, how I try."</p>
            <p>Death introduces himself as the narrator, explaining that he has seen the book thief three times. The first time, the sky was white.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Journey to Himmel Street</h2>
            <p>Liesel Meminger, nine years old, travels by train with her mother and younger brother Werner toward their new foster home in Molching, Germany. It is January 1939, and their mother cannot keep them anymore.</p>
            <p>Werner coughs continuously. He has been sick for some time. On the train, in the cold, in his sister's arms, he dies.</p>
            <p>The train stops. Two guards come to remove the body. Liesel's mother cannot speak. The boy is buried in a small cemetery along the railway line, in snow and frozen earth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stolen-book">
            <h4>The First Stolen Book</h4>
            <p><strong>The Grave Digger's Handbook</strong> falls from a young apprentice's coat as he helps bury Werner. Liesel picks it up from the snow and hides it beneath her dress.</p>
            <p>She cannot read a single word. But this book, dropped beside her brother's grave, becomes the first possession that truly belongs to her. It connects her to death, to loss, and to the power that words will hold over her life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>33 Himmel Street</h2>
            <p>Liesel arrives at her foster home filthy and terrified. Rosa Hubermann, a squat woman with a cardboard face, stands waiting. Hans Hubermann, tall and silver-eyed, offers his hand.</p>
            <p>Rosa calls everyone "Saumensch" and "Saukerl" (pig-woman and pig-man). Hans smells of paint and cigarettes. Their house is small and cold. Liesel refuses to leave the car.</p>
            <p>Hans waits. Eventually, he carries her inside.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="character-box">
            <h4>Hans Hubermann</h4>
            <div class="role">Foster Father</div>
            <p>A house painter by trade, an accordion player by passion. His eyes are made of silver and kindness. He fought in the first World War and survived because a Jewish man taught him to play music instead of charging into battle.</p>
            <p>He is patient where Rosa is harsh. He will sit with Liesel through her nightmares every night, never complaining, never leaving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Nightmares Begin</h2>
            <p>Every night, Liesel dreams of her brother's face. She sees him dying. She sees the train. She wakes screaming, sheets soaked with sweat.</p>
            <p>Every night, Hans comes to her room. He sits on the edge of her bed. He waits until she can breathe again. He does not tell her it will be okay. He simply stays.</p>
            <p>One night, he discovers The Grave Digger's Handbook beneath her mattress. Instead of taking it away, he begins to teach her to read.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hope-box">
            <h4>The Midnight Classroom</h4>
            <p>In the basement, by candlelight, Hans Hubermann paints the alphabet on the walls. Letter by letter, word by word, Liesel begins to read.</p>
            <p>They use sandpaper and paint. They write words on the floor and wash them away. The basement becomes her school, and The Grave Digger's Handbook becomes her first reader.</p>
            <p>A book about burying the dead teaches a girl how to live.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Himmel Street</h2>
            <p>"Himmel" means "heaven" in German. But Himmel Street is no heaven. It is a poor neighborhood in a small town, full of small houses and smaller lives.</p>
            <p>The Hubermanns' neighbors include Frau Holtzapfel (who spits on their door), Frau Diller (the Nazi shopkeeper), and the Steiners, whose son Rudy will become Liesel's best friend and partner in petty crime.</p>
            <p>Liesel will come to love this street and everyone on it. Death will eventually take them all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Reflects</h4>
            <p>"I wanted to tell the book thief many things, about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn't already know? I wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race—that rarely do I ever simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and brilliant."</p>
