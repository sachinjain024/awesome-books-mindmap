            <h4>Death Speaks</h4>
            <p>"Some people said that Max Vandenburg's arrival in Molching was inevitable. Others said it was dangerous, irresponsible, and suicidal. But I say this: it was a result of a promise."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Promise</h2>
            <p>In the First World War, a German soldier named Hans Hubermann served alongside a Jewish man named Erik Vandenburg. Erik taught Hans to play the accordion. More importantly, Erik saved Hans's life.</p>
            <p>On the day Erik died—the day their unit was sent on a suicide mission—Hans was spared because he was writing letters for the captain. Erik's accordion remained. Hans carried it home.</p>
            <p>Hans visited Erik's widow. He told her: if you ever need anything, find me. She never forgot.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Max Vandenburg</h2>
            <p>Twenty-two years later, Erik's son Max is hiding in Stuttgart, watching his family get taken away. He is twenty-four years old, a fist-fighter, a Jew without papers or hope.</p>
            <p>His mother gives him a folded paper: an address in Molching. The name of Hans Hubermann.</p>
            <p>Max survives by hiding. He travels by darkness. He carries a copy of Mein Kampf—Hitler's book—because nothing looks less suspicious than a young German man reading the Fuhrer's words.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="historical-context">
            <h4>Germany, 1940</h4>
            <p>The persecution of Jews has escalated. Kristallnacht happened two years ago. Jews have been stripped of citizenship, forbidden to work, marked with stars. The camps have begun their work.</p>
            <p>To hide a Jew is to risk everything: arrest, execution, the destruction of your entire family. Hans knows this. Rosa knows this. They take Max anyway.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="character-box">
            <h4>Max Vandenburg</h4>
            <div class="role">The Hidden Jew</div>
            <p>A young man made of bones and rage and survival. He has fist-fought his way through his childhood, been beaten and betrayed and abandoned. He hates himself for surviving when his family did not.</p>
            <p>But Max is also an artist. He paints on the pages of Hitler's book, covering hate with images. He writes stories for a girl who steals books. In the basement of 33 Himmel Street, he finds something like family.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Arrival</h2>
            <p>Max arrives at night, starving and half-dead. Hans brings him into the basement. Rosa, despite her harshness, nurses him back to health.</p>
            <p>Liesel is told: there is a man in the basement. You must never speak of him. Not to anyone. Not to Rudy. Not ever.</p>
            <p>At first, Liesel is afraid of Max. He is strange and thin, with hair like feathers and eyes that hold too much. But she understands secrets. She keeps this one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Reflects</h4>
            <p>"The consequence of hiding a Jew was not lost on Hans Hubermann. He knew the cost. He knew that if discovered, they would all be taken—Rosa, Liesel, and himself. They would be sent to the camps that everyone whispered about and nobody believed."</p>
            <p>"He hid Max anyway. Some promises must be kept."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Basement Life</h2>
            <p>Max cannot go upstairs during the day. The neighbors might see. He exercises in the dark, doing push-ups and sit-ups to stay sane. He reads by candlelight. He begins to paint.</p>
            <p>Using the copy of Mein Kampf he carried from Stuttgart, Max paints over Hitler's words with his own images. He covers hate with art, one page at a time.</p>
            <p>This is rebellion in its purest form: taking the Fuhrer's weapon and turning it into something beautiful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hope-box">
            <h4>The Seeds of Friendship</h4>
            <p>Liesel begins visiting Max in the basement. At first, she brings him food. Then she brings him weather reports—describing the sky he cannot see. Then she brings him words.</p>
            <p>They discover they share the same nightmare: a train, a dying family member, the inability to save them. Liesel dreams of Werner. Max dreams of everyone.</p>
            <p>Two people haunted by the same ghosts begin to find peace in each other's company.</p>
