            <h2>After the War</h2>
            <p>The war ends. Germany surrenders. The camps are liberated. The world begins the long process of reckoning with what happened.</p>
            <p>Liesel lives with Ilsa Hermann. She finishes school. She grows into a young woman. She never stops reading, never stops writing. But she also never stops grieving.</p>
            <p>And then, one day, Max Vandenburg appears.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hope-box">
            <h4>Max Returns</h4>
            <p>He survived. Somehow, impossibly, Max survived the war. He went to Dachau, but he came out alive. He searched for the Hubermanns. He found only Liesel.</p>
            <p>They embrace on the doorstep of the mayor's house. Two people bound by painted words and shared nightmares. Two word shakers who planted seeds that outlasted Hitler's forest.</p>
            <p>They have found each other again.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>A Life Lived</h2>
            <p>Liesel emigrates to Sydney, Australia. She marries. She has children. She runs a small business with her husband. She lives an ordinary, extraordinary life.</p>
            <p>She never forgets Himmel Street. She never forgets the people she lost. Their names are written on her heart in the same letters Hans painted on the basement walls.</p>
            <p>She keeps Max's painted books. She keeps The Standover Man and The Word Shaker. She keeps them until the end.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Final Visit</h2>
            <p>Liesel Meminger dies as an old woman in Sydney. Her children and grandchildren surround her. She has lived a long life, full of words and love and loss.</p>
            <p>Death comes to collect her. He has come for her three times before, but always she escaped him. This time, she is ready.</p>
            <p>And Death has a gift for her.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Returns the Book</h4>
            <p>"I handed her the book. The Book Thief. Her own handwritten words, rescued from the rubble of Himmel Street all those decades ago."</p>
            <p>"'You kept it,' she said."</p>
            <p>"'I told you I would.'"</p>
            <p>"She held it to her chest. It was creased and faded and covered in the dust of a German street that no longer existed. But every word was still there. Every person she loved. Every book she stole."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="book-quote">
            <p>"I wanted to tell the book thief many things, about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn't already know? I wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race—that rarely do I ever simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and its words and stories so damning and brilliant."</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Death's Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Death reflects on what he has learned from watching Liesel Meminger. He has seen the worst of humanity—the wars, the camps, the calculated cruelty. But he has also seen the best: a girl stealing books from fire, a man hiding in a basement, a kiss given too late but given nonetheless.</p>
            <p>Humans confuse him. They are capable of such destruction and such grace. They write Mein Kampf and they write The Word Shaker. They build concentration camps and they build libraries with open windows.</p>
            <p>"I am haunted by humans," Death says. It is both complaint and compliment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Final Words</h4>
            <p>"The book thief has struck for the last time. But her words remain. That's the thing about words—they don't die when their authors do. They live on, waiting for the next reader, the next thief, the next person who needs to be saved by a story."</p>
            <p>"Liesel Meminger stole books. But more importantly, she gave them away. To Max. To Frau Holtzapfel. To the neighbors in the bomb shelter. To all of us."</p>
            <p>"That is her legacy. That is what survives."</p>

            <h3>The Book's Final Message</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Words Outlast Death:</strong> Stories survive their tellers. What we write continues to speak after we are gone.</li>
                <li><strong>Humanity's Duality:</strong> We are capable of both unspeakable cruelty and profound beauty. The same species that builds death camps also creates art.</li>
                <li><strong>The Power of Witness:</strong> By telling stories, we bear witness. We ensure that those who are gone are not forgotten.</li>
                <li><strong>Death as Observer:</strong> Even Death is moved by human stories. Even the collector of souls is haunted by what he sees.</li>
                <li><strong>Love in Small Acts:</strong> Heroism lives in painted alphabets on basement walls, in weather reports for hidden Jews, in kisses given too late.</li>
            </ul>
