            <h4>Death Speaks</h4>
            <p>"The second time I saw the book thief, the sky was the color of Jews—red, the color of flames."</p>
            <p>It is the Fuhrer's birthday, April 20, 1940. Molching celebrates with a bonfire of books.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Rudy Steiner</h2>
            <p>Liesel's neighbor and soon her best friend is a skinny boy with bony legs and hair the color of lemons. Rudy Steiner has six siblings and a father who refuses to let him join the Hitler Youth elite.</p>
            <p>At age seven, Rudy painted himself black with charcoal and ran the hundred meters at the local track, pretending to be Jesse Owens. His father had to explain why a German boy cannot want to be a Black man, no matter how fast that man can run.</p>
            <p>Rudy doesn't fully understand. He still loves Jesse Owens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="character-box">
            <h4>Rudy Steiner</h4>
            <div class="role">Best Friend</div>
            <p>A boy made of lemon hair and blue eyes, of stolen apples and desperate courage. He will follow Liesel anywhere—into frozen rivers, through stolen-book windows, across any line she draws.</p>
            <p>He asks Liesel for a kiss approximately fourteen thousand times. She always says no. She will regret this forever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>School and Shame</h2>
            <p>Liesel attends school but is placed with the younger children because she cannot read. The other students mock her. She beats up one boy, Ludwig Schmeikl, badly enough that he has to be carried home.</p>
            <p>At home, Hans continues the basement lessons. Letter by letter, Liesel catches up. Words become her refuge from humiliation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="historical-context">
            <h4>The Fuhrer's Birthday</h4>
            <p>April 20, 1940. The town gathers in the square to celebrate Hitler's birthday. There are speeches about German greatness. There are songs about the Fatherland. And there is a bonfire.</p>
            <p>Books deemed "un-German" are piled high and set ablaze. Jewish authors. Communist authors. Anyone who threatens the purity of German thought. The townspeople watch. Some cheer. Most simply stand.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Book Burning</h2>
            <p>Liesel stands with Rosa and Hans, watching the flames consume towers of books. She does not understand all the politics, but she understands this: they are burning words. The very things that Hans has been teaching her to love.</p>
            <p>The fire dies down. The crowd disperses. Liesel lingers.</p>
            <p>In the smoldering remains, she spots a book that has survived. Its edges are singed, but its pages remain. She looks around. No one is watching—except one person.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stolen-book">
            <h4>The Second Stolen Book</h4>
            <p><strong>The Shoulder Shrug</strong>—a novel that should have burned. Liesel pulls it from the embers, burning her hands, and hides it beneath her clothes.</p>
            <p>She does not notice the mayor's wife watching from across the square. Ilsa Hermann sees everything: the girl, the burning hands, the hidden book. She says nothing.</p>
            <p>This moment will change Liesel's life. The mayor's wife will remember. And one day, she will open her library.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Injury</h2>
            <p>Liesel's hands are badly burned. Hans notices immediately. Instead of anger, he treats her wounds and asks to see the book.</p>
            <p>They read The Shoulder Shrug together in the basement, adding it to their growing collection of painted words on the walls. Hans does not tell Rosa. This is their secret.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="death-narration">
            <h4>Death Reflects</h4>
            <p>"I have seen a great many things. I have attended all the world's worst disasters, and I have watched people do unspeakable things to each other. But I have also seen a girl steal a book from a fire. I have seen her blow on her burning fingers and hide words against her chest like treasure."</p>
            <p>"The question is: what kind of power does a book hold? The answer: all kinds."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Words as Rebellion</h2>
            <p>By stealing a book from a Nazi fire, Liesel commits her first conscious act of resistance. She does not frame it this way—she is only eleven. But she understands that the men with torches are destroying something precious.</p>
            <p>In the ashes of the Fuhrer's birthday celebration, a girl becomes a book thief in earnest. Not from snow beside a grave, but from the burning heart of Nazi hatred.</p>
