        title: Life is Poker, Not Chess
        description: Chess has perfect information — life doesn't. Like poker, most decisions are made under uncertainty with incomplete information. Great decisions don't guarantee great outcomes, and bad luck can punish even the best choices.

      - number: 2
        title: Wanna Bet?
        description: Framing every belief and decision as a bet forces rigorous thinking. When you're willing to put something at stake, you examine your assumptions more honestly and acknowledge the uncertainty baked into every choice.

  - title: LEARNING FROM OUTCOMES
    chapters:
      - number: 3
        title: "Bet to Learn: Fielding Outcomes"
        description: Outcomes are not reliable signals of decision quality. Learning to separate luck from skill — and to fight self-serving bias — is how we extract real lessons from experience rather than false ones.

  - title: BUILDING BETTER HABITS
    chapters:
      - number: 4
        title: The Buddy System
        description: A truth-seeking peer group — a "decision pod" — holds us accountable and helps us see blind spots. Good decision partners provide honest, caring feedback rather than comfortable validation.

      - number: 5
        title: Dissent to Win
        description: Productive disagreement strengthens decisions. Seeking out opposing views, acting as devil's advocate, and fostering a culture of constructive dissent prevents costly groupthink.

  - title: THINKING IN TIME
    chapters:
      - number: 6
        title: Adventures in Mental Time Travel
        description: Tools like 10-10-10 analysis, backcasting, and premortem help us escape the grip of present-day emotion and make decisions our future self will endorse rather than regret.

keyTeachings:
  - principle: "Resulting:"
    description: Don't judge the quality of a decision by its outcome alone. Good decisions can produce bad outcomes (bad luck), and bad decisions can produce good outcomes (good luck). Confusing the two is the root of many thinking errors.

  - principle: "Thinking in Bets:"
    description: Every decision is a bet on the future. Adopting this frame forces you to acknowledge uncertainty, assign honest probabilities, and think more carefully before committing.

  - principle: "Separating Luck from Skill:"
    description: When analyzing outcomes, ask how much was within your control (skill) and how much was outside it (luck). This honest attribution is the key to learning from experience without being misled by noise.

  - principle: "Truth-Seeking Peer Groups:"
    description: Surround yourself with people committed to accuracy over comfort. A good decision pod will challenge your reasoning honestly, not simply validate your conclusions and reinforce your biases.

  - principle: "Mental Time Travel:"
    description: Imagine your future self looking back on a decision. Backcasting (envisioning success and working backward) and premortem (envisioning failure) reveal blind spots and improve commitment to long-term goals.

  - principle: "10-10-10 Thinking:"
    description: Before deciding, ask — how will I feel about this in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years? Extending your time horizon prevents short-term emotions from hijacking decisions that affect your long-term wellbeing.

## About This Book

*Thinking in Bets* is a practical guide to decision-making under uncertainty, written by Annie Duke — a former World Series of Poker champion turned decision strategist and author. The book draws on Duke's experience at the poker table and on decades of research in psychology, economics, and behavioral science to reveal how the best decision-makers think differently from everyone else.

The central insight is deceptively simple: **we can't control outcomes, only the quality of our decisions**. Yet we constantly judge our choices — and other people's choices — by whether they happened to work out. Duke calls this "resulting," and it's one of the most pervasive and destructive thinking errors we make. A surgeon who loses a patient isn't necessarily a bad surgeon. A driver who runs a red light and makes it through safely didn't make a good decision. Outcome and process are separate things, and conflating them makes it impossible to learn from experience.

This mind map distills the book's six core chapters into an accessible framework for everyday thinking. From recognizing the role of luck to building truth-seeking relationships to using mental time travel before big decisions, each chapter equips you with concrete tools. Whether you're a manager weighing strategic choices, an investor navigating markets, or simply someone who wants to make fewer regrettable decisions, *Thinking in Bets* offers a rigorous, honest approach to living with uncertainty — which is to say, to living.
