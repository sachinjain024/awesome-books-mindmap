## Introduction {.intro}

This chapter introduces the most important concept in the book: managerial leverage. Grove argues that a manager's output is not what they personally produce, but the output of their organization and neighboring organizations they influence. The question becomes: how do you maximize this output?

## The Manager's Output Equation

Grove presents the fundamental equation that defines managerial effectiveness:

### The Output Equation {.equation-box}

Manager's Output = Output of Organization + Output of Neighboring Organizations Under Influence

You are not measured by how busy you are or how hard you work. You are measured by the output of your team and the teams you influence. This reframes everything a manager does.

## What Is Leverage?

Leverage is the relationship between the activity you perform and the output it generates. High-leverage activities produce disproportionately large outputs relative to the time invested.

### Leverage Formula {.equation-box}

Output = Activity × Leverage

Same time investment, different leverage = vastly different outputs

## High-Leverage Activities

Grove identifies three ways to achieve high leverage:

### Three Types of High Leverage {.leverage-box}

1. **When many people are affected:** A decision or action that impacts many people multiplies your effect (e.g., company-wide policy, training program)
2. **When your activity affects someone's work over a long time:** Early input or direction that shapes work for weeks or months (e.g., planning, coaching, direction-setting)
3. **When you provide unique knowledge or insight:** Information only you can provide that unblocks others (e.g., technical expertise, organizational context)

## Examples of Leverage

### High-Leverage Activities {.example-box}

- **Performance reviews:** 30 minutes invested shapes someone's work for 6+ months
- **Training:** Your hour teaches skills used for years
- **One-on-ones:** Early course-correction prevents weeks of wasted work
- **Delegation with coaching:** Multiplies your capacity through others

### Low-Leverage Traps {.warning-box}

- **Doing work yourself:** Scales only with your hours
- **Unnecessary meetings:** Time consumed with little output
- **Micromanaging:** Your time input, their output limitation
- **Email ping-pong:** Activity without impact

## Negative Leverage

Leverage can be negative. A manager's poor behavior or bad decision can damage output far more than their positive contribution could help.

### Sources of Negative Leverage {.indicator-box}

- **Meddling:** Interfering at the wrong time, undoing others' work
- **Waffling:** Delayed decisions that block many people
- **Mood contagion:** A manager's bad mood demoralizes the entire team
- **Lack of preparation:** Unprepared manager wastes everyone's time in meetings

> "The leverage of a manager can be positive or negative. A discouraged manager will depress the output of his entire team. An unprepared manager wastes the time of everyone in the meeting."
> — Andy Grove

## Delegation and Leverage

Delegation is how managers multiply their leverage—but only if done correctly. Delegation is not abdication.

### Effective Delegation {.principle-box}

- **Match task to TRM:** Delegate to someone with appropriate task-relevant maturity
- **Monitor appropriately:** Check at key milestones, not constantly
- **Provide context:** Share the "why" so they can make good decisions
- **Maintain accountability:** Delegating the task doesn't delegate responsibility

## How Managers Spend Time

Grove examined how managers actually spend their time and found that activities fall into three categories:

- **Information Gathering:** Collecting data, reading reports, having conversations
- **Information Giving:** Sharing knowledge, coaching, communicating decisions
- **Decision Making:** Analyzing options, making choices, allocating resources

The key is not doing fewer activities, but doing the **right** activities—those with highest leverage.

## Key Takeaways

- Manager's output = output of their team + influenced teams, not personal production
- High-leverage activities affect many people, have long-lasting impact, or provide unique value
- Leverage can be negative—bad decisions or moods damage output disproportionately
- Delegation multiplies leverage but requires matching task to person's readiness
- Focus on the leverage of activities, not just the activity level itself
- Training and one-on-ones are among the highest-leverage activities
