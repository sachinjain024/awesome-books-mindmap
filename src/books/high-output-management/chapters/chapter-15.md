## Introduction {.intro}

Money matters—not just as purchasing power, but as a signal. Compensation sends powerful messages about what the organization values. This chapter explores how to use compensation as a form of feedback that reinforces desired performance.

## Money as Message

Beyond enabling people to pay bills, compensation communicates:

### What Compensation Signals {.concept-box}

- How the organization values your contribution
- Where you stand relative to peers
- What behaviors and results are rewarded
- Your trajectory within the organization

> "Money has a powerful significance that goes beyond its purchasing power: it's a measure of one's worth and achievement."
> — Andy Grove

## The Comparison Problem

People inevitably compare their compensation to others. This creates challenges:

### Comparison Dynamics {.warning-box}

- People compare to peers, not to market
- Perceived unfairness is demotivating
- Compression (everyone paid similarly) rewards mediocrity
- Large gaps create resentment if not justified

## Performance-Based Pay

Grove advocates for compensation that reflects performance differences:

### Performance Differentiation {.principle-box}

- Top performers should earn significantly more
- Raises should vary meaningfully by performance level
- Average raises for average performance—not inflation plus
- Be willing to give small or no raises for below-average work

### Raise Differentiation Example {.comparison-box}

**Low Differentiation:**
- Exceeds: 5%
- Meets: 4%
- Below: 3%

Signal: Performance doesn't really matter

**High Differentiation:**
- Exceeds: 10%+
- Meets: 4%
- Below: 0%

Signal: Performance truly matters

## Communicating Compensation

How you communicate compensation is as important as the number:

### Effective Communication {.leverage-box}

- Connect the number to specific performance
- Explain how it compares to peers (generally, not specifically)
- Link to future expectations
- Be direct about what drives pay increases

## When Money Isn't Enough

Remember Maslow: once basic needs are met, money's motivational power diminishes. For self-actualized employees, other factors matter more:

### Beyond Money {.concept-box}

- Challenging work
- Recognition and respect
- Autonomy and ownership
- Growth opportunities
- Meaningful impact

## Key Takeaways

- Compensation is a signal of value, not just purchasing power
- Differentiate pay meaningfully by performance—sameness rewards mediocrity
- Be willing to give zero or small raises for below-average performance
- Communicate compensation decisions clearly, linked to performance
- For self-actualized employees, money alone isn't enough
