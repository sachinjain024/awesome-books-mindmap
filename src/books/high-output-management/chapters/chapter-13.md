## Introduction {.intro}

Performance reviews are among the most dreaded activities in management—both for givers and receivers. Yet Grove argues they're among the highest-leverage activities a manager can perform. Done well, a review shapes someone's performance for months or years. This chapter explains how to do them well.

## Why Reviews Matter

A performance review is one of the highest-leverage activities available to a manager:

### The Leverage of Reviews {.leverage-box}

- A few hours of preparation and conversation
- Affects someone's performance for 6-12 months
- Shapes career direction and motivation
- Documents expectations and agreements

> "The performance review is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback we as supervisors can provide."
> — Andy Grove

## Two Assessments

Every review should include two distinct assessments:

### Performance vs. Potential {.comparison-box}

**Performance Assessment:**
How did they do against objectives?
- Results achieved
- Quality of work
- Meeting commitments
- Past-focused

**Potential Assessment:**
What might they achieve?
- Growth trajectory
- Capability development
- Readiness for more
- Future-focused

Someone can have high performance but limited potential (peaked), or low performance but high potential (developing). These require different conversations.

## Delivering the Review

Grove provides specific guidance on delivering feedback effectively:

### Delivery Principles {.principle-box}

1. **Be direct:** Don't bury criticism in praise
2. **Be specific:** Use concrete examples, not vague generalizations
3. **Be balanced:** Include both strengths and areas for growth
4. **Focus on behavior:** What they did, not who they are
5. **Listen:** Make it a dialogue, not a lecture

## The "Breakfast and Lunch" Problem

Grove identifies a common failure mode: managers give glowing reviews all year, then are surprised when the employee is shocked by criticism during the formal review.

### The Surprise Problem {.warning-box}

If your review contains surprises, you've already failed. Feedback should be continuous throughout the year. The formal review summarizes and documents what should already be known.

## Giving Negative Feedback

Negative feedback is difficult but essential. Grove's approach:

### Delivering Difficult Messages {.principle-box}

- **Don't avoid it:** Failing to address problems is unfair to the employee
- **Be specific:** "Your code reviews lack detail" not "You need to improve"
- **Explain impact:** Help them understand why it matters
- **Offer path forward:** What specifically should change
- **Follow up:** Check progress on improvement areas

## The Written Review

Grove insists on written reviews. Writing forces clarity and creates a record.

### Elements of Written Review {.concept-box}

- Summary of performance against objectives
- Key strengths demonstrated
- Areas requiring improvement
- Specific development actions
- Objectives for next period

## Levels of Performance

Grove suggests thinking about performance in distinct levels:

- **Exceeds:** Consistently surpasses expectations
- **Meets:** Fully meets role requirements
- **Below:** Not meeting some requirements

Be honest about which level applies. Rating everyone "exceeds" makes the system meaningless.

## Key Takeaways

- Performance reviews are high-leverage—hours of work affect months of performance
- Assess both performance (past) and potential (future)
- Be direct, specific, and behavior-focused
- Reviews should contain no surprises—give continuous feedback year-round
- Write the review—writing forces clarity
- Be honest about performance levels
