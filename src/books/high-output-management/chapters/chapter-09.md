## Introduction {.intro}

In matrix organizations, dual reporting is common—you report to two (or more) managers. This chapter provides practical guidance for navigating this complexity effectively, both as a subordinate with multiple bosses and as a manager who shares subordinates.

## The Middle Manager's Challenge

Middle managers often find themselves caught between competing demands. You must satisfy your business unit head and your functional manager, whose priorities may conflict.

### Common Dual Reporting Problems {.warning-box}

- Conflicting priorities from different bosses
- Unclear escalation paths
- Being caught in political crossfire
- Overcommitment from agreeing to everything

## Managing Up with Multiple Bosses

### Dual Reporting Survival Guide {.principle-box}

1. **Clarify expectations:** Get explicit about what each boss expects
2. **Surface conflicts early:** Don't hide conflicts—bring them up before they explode
3. **Propose solutions:** Don't just present problems; offer recommendations
4. **Keep both informed:** Proactive communication prevents surprises
5. **Build relationships:** Trust makes conflict resolution easier

## When Priorities Conflict

When your two bosses want different things, you have several options:

### Conflict Resolution Approaches {.concept-box}

- **Sequence:** Can you do both if you do them in order?
- **Negotiate:** Can either party compromise?
- **Escalate:** If unresolvable, push the decision upward
- **Default rules:** Does the organization have a tiebreaker (e.g., "customer first")?

## Sharing Subordinates

If you're a manager who shares subordinates with another manager, you must coordinate:

### Coordination with Peer Managers {.leverage-box}

- Align on expectations before communicating to subordinate
- Discuss workload and priorities regularly
- Jointly handle performance discussions
- Resolve conflicts between yourselves, not through the subordinate

## Key Takeaways

- Dual reporting is common in matrix organizations—learn to navigate it
- Clarify expectations with both bosses upfront
- Surface conflicts early rather than hiding them
- When priorities conflict: sequence, negotiate, or escalate
