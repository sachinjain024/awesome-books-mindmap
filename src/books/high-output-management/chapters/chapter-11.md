## Introduction {.intro}

What motivates people at work? Grove explores motivation through the lens of sports and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Understanding motivation is essential because as a manager, you can't do the work yourself—you must work through others who choose to perform.

## Maslow's Hierarchy and Work

Grove applies Maslow's hierarchy of needs to understand workplace motivation:

### Needs at Work {.concept-box}

- **Physiological:** Salary sufficient to meet basic needs
- **Safety:** Job security, stable employment
- **Social:** Belonging to a team, workplace relationships
- **Esteem:** Recognition, status, achievement
- **Self-actualization:** Reaching one's potential, mastery, meaning

Once a lower need is satisfied, it no longer motivates. A person earning enough to live isn't motivated by more basic salary—they want recognition, achievement, or meaning.

## Self-Actualization: The Highest Motivator

At the highest level, people are motivated by **self-actualization**—the drive to become the best they can be, to achieve mastery, to fulfill their potential.

> "Self-actualization means the need to achieve one's utter personal best in a chosen field of endeavor. Once someone's source of motivation is self-actualization, his drive to perform has no limit."
> — Andy Grove

## The Sports Analogy

Why do athletes push themselves to exhaustion for no financial reward (in amateur sports)? Grove argues it's self-actualization—the drive to achieve their personal best. The same motivation can drive employees.

### What Sports Teaches Us {.example-box}

- **Clear goals:** Athletes know what winning means
- **Immediate feedback:** The scoreboard doesn't lie
- **Competition:** Measuring against others drives performance
- **Team pride:** Not wanting to let teammates down
- **Mastery:** The satisfaction of getting better

## Fear and Achievement

Grove identifies two types of motivation that drive performance:

### Two Motivational Drivers {.comparison-box}

**Fear-Driven:**
- Fear of failure
- Fear of punishment
- Works but creates stress
- Can backfire when overused

**Achievement-Driven:**
- Desire for mastery
- Pride in accomplishment
- Sustainable and energizing
- Creates positive culture

Both can motivate, but achievement-driven motivation is more sustainable and creates better organizational culture.

## Creating Conditions for Achievement

Managers can't directly motivate people. But they can create conditions where achievement motivation flourishes:

### Manager's Role in Motivation {.leverage-box}

- Set clear, challenging goals
- Provide regular feedback on performance
- Create healthy competition
- Celebrate achievements publicly
- Offer opportunities for mastery and growth

## Output Measures and Motivation

Like sports, work needs scoreboards. People need to know how they're doing. This requires clear output measures.

### Good Output Measures {.principle-box}

- **Objective:** Not subject to opinion
- **Timely:** Fast enough to enable course correction
- **Relevant:** Connected to what matters
- **Visible:** Everyone can see the score

## Key Takeaways

- Motivation follows Maslow's hierarchy—higher needs emerge as lower ones are met
- Self-actualization—the drive for mastery—is the most powerful motivator
- Sports shows how clear goals, feedback, and competition drive performance
- Managers create conditions for motivation; they can't inject it directly
- Output measures are scoreboards—people need to know how they're doing
