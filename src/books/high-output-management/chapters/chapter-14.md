## Introduction {.intro}

Two of the most difficult tasks managers face: interviewing candidates and handling the resignation of a valued employee. Both are emotionally charged and consequential. This chapter provides practical frameworks for navigating each.

## Part 1: Interviewing

Interviewing is deceptively difficult. You're trying to predict future performance based on a brief conversation. Most interviews fail to gather useful information.

### Common Interview Failures {.warning-box}

- Talking more than listening
- Asking hypothetical questions
- Failing to probe beneath surface answers
- Confusing likeability with competence
- Not checking for cultural fit

## The Purpose of Interviewing

An interview has four goals:

### What to Assess {.concept-box}

1. **Technical knowledge:** Can they do the job?
2. **Past performance:** What have they actually accomplished?
3. **Discrepancies:** Do their stories add up?
4. **Operational values:** How do they work? Will they fit?

## Grove's Interview Technique

### Effective Interview Questions {.principle-box}

- **"Describe a project you're proud of."** — Reveals what they value and how they think about their work
- **"What were the problems? How did you solve them?"** — Probes for depth beyond the surface story
- **"Why did you leave your last job?"** — Reveals motivation and self-awareness
- **"What would you do in your first 90 days?"** — Shows how they approach new situations

> "Your job as an interviewer is to get the candidate to reveal themselves. The best way to do this is to ask open-ended questions about their actual experience, then probe deeply."
> — Andy Grove

## Listen More Than Talk

A common mistake: the interviewer talks 80% of the time, "selling" the job. Grove recommends the opposite—listen 80%, talk 20%.

### Interview Time Allocation {.leverage-box}

- 20% — You talking (about the role, company, answering questions)
- 80% — Candidate talking (about their experience, approach, questions)

## Part 2: Handling Resignation

When a valued employee resigns, it's emotionally difficult. But how you handle it matters—both for that person and for everyone watching.

### What's at Stake {.warning-box}

- Losing a valuable contributor
- Knowledge walking out the door
- Signal to remaining team members
- Your reputation as a manager

## First Response to Resignation

### Step 1: Drop Everything {.principle-box}

When someone tells you they're leaving, nothing is more important. Cancel your next meeting. Give them your full attention. This signals respect and creates space for a real conversation.

### Step 2: Listen to Understand {.principle-box}

Don't immediately try to counter-offer. First, understand *why* they're leaving. Often the stated reason isn't the real reason. Listen deeply.

## To Counter-Offer or Not

### Counter-Offer Considerations {.concept-box}

- **If it's about money:** You can counter, but ask yourself why you weren't paying them fairly before
- **If it's about the job:** Can you genuinely change what's frustrating them?
- **If it's about management:** This is feedback—can you act on it?
- **If it's about growth:** Is there a real path forward here?

### The Counter-Offer Trap {.warning-box}

Even if a counter-offer is accepted, the relationship is often damaged. The employee has mentally moved on. Statistics show most people who accept counter-offers leave within a year anyway.

## Learning from Departures

Every resignation is a learning opportunity. Conduct a proper exit interview:

### Exit Interview Questions {.leverage-box}

- What could we have done differently?
- What did you like best about working here?
- What frustrations did you experience?
- What advice would you give us?

## Key Takeaways

- In interviews, listen 80% and talk 20%—your job is to learn about them
- Assess: technical ability, past performance, consistency, operational values
- When someone resigns, drop everything and give them full attention
- Understand the real reason before considering counter-offers
- Counter-offers often fail—the relationship is damaged
- Treat every departure as a learning opportunity
