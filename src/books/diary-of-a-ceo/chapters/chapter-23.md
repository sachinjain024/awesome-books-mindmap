## The Ostrich Instinct

When reality is uncomfortable, the natural human impulse is to minimise, avoid, or deny it. The ostrich burying its head in the sand — metaphorically — is a universal human tendency, not a quirk of weak individuals.

When a business is losing money, founders often focus on product launches instead of cash flow. When a relationship is deteriorating, partners often increase busyness to avoid the difficult conversation. When a project is behind, teams often report optimistically in status meetings rather than escalating the real situation.

Steven Bartlett identifies this instinct as one of the most costly habits a leader can have, because **the problems you refuse to see don't disappear — they compound.**

<div class="insight-box">
<h4>The Blind Spot Premium</h4>
<p>Problems have a price, and that price increases over time. The cost of acknowledging and addressing a problem on day one is almost always a fraction of the cost of acknowledging and addressing it on day one hundred. Every day of delay is a day of compounding — and the most significant compounding often happens in the final period before the problem becomes unavoidable.</p>

## Why Smart People Are Ostriches

The ostrich instinct is not a sign of stupidity. It is often a sign of the opposite — a sophisticated capacity to rationalise avoidance in intellectually convincing ways.

Common rationalisations:
- "It's probably not as bad as it seems"
- "We'll figure it out once we get through this immediate period"
- "If I raise this now, it might create panic"
- "I don't want to be negative — maybe things will improve"
- "I don't have all the information yet to know for sure"

Each of these sounds reasonable. Each is potentially a way of avoiding a truth that requires uncomfortable action.

<h4>The Core Law</h4>
<p>Develop the discipline to face harsh realities immediately and completely. The courage to see clearly and speak truthfully about what is real is the most valuable leadership quality available — and among the rarest.</p>
</div>

## The Four Practices of Clear Seeing

Bartlett outlines four practices for combating the ostrich instinct:

**1. Pause and review.** Build deliberate pauses into your rhythm — weekly, monthly, quarterly — specifically designed to ask "what am I not looking at?"

**2. Speak truth.** Create the habit of naming what you see, even when naming it is uncomfortable. The act of articulating a problem publicly makes it real in a way that private acknowledgment often doesn't.

**3. Seek truth.** Actively invite perspectives that contradict your current view. Surround yourself with people willing to tell you hard truths. Guard against yes-men environments.

**4. Audit your blind spots.** Systematically examine the areas you tend to avoid. Where do your reviews consistently come back positive? Where do you consistently assume things are fine without checking?

<div class="practice-box">
<h4>The Uncomfortable Truth Exercise</h4>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions honestly:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the one thing in my business or life that I most avoid looking at directly?</li>
<li>If that situation continued exactly as it is for another 12 months, what would the result be?</li>
<li>What is the honest assessment of that situation right now — not the optimistic version, the real one?</li>
<li>What is the first action that honest assessment requires?</li>
</ol>
</div>

## The Leader's Responsibility for Clear Seeing

For leaders, the ostrich instinct has an additional dimension: it trains teams to be ostriches as well. When leaders consistently receive and deliver optimistic, incomplete pictures of reality, the culture adapts to produce exactly that. People learn what version of truth is acceptable and filter accordingly.

Leaders who model radical honesty about hard realities — their own mistakes, real problems, uncomfortable data — create cultures where truth flows freely. And organisations where truth flows freely solve problems far faster than organisations where truth is selectively shared.

## Key Takeaways

- The problems you refuse to see don't disappear — they compound, with costs that escalate over time
- The ostrich instinct is not stupidity; it is a sophisticated capacity to rationalise avoidance with plausible-sounding reasons
- The four practices of clear seeing: pause and review, speak truth, seek truth, and audit your blind spots
- Leaders who model avoidance create cultures of avoidance; leaders who model radical honesty create cultures where problems are surfaced and solved
- The cost of facing a problem on day one is almost always a fraction of the cost on day one hundred
