## Commands vs. Questions

Most leaders and communicators default to telling: telling people what to do, what to think, what to change, and how to behave. This feels efficient. It is almost always counterproductive.

When you tell someone what to do, you generate compliance at best and resentment at worst. You've given them a solution that they have no ownership of, no investment in, and no real commitment to following through on.

When you ask the right question, something entirely different happens. The person generates the answer themselves. They discover the insight. They feel the commitment. You haven't pushed them — you've pulled them.

<div class="insight-box">
<h4>The Self-Generated Commitment Effect</h4>
<p>Research consistently shows that commitments we make to ourselves feel far more binding than those imposed on us by others. When someone arrives at a conclusion through their own reasoning — guided by your questions — their motivation to act on it is vastly higher than if you had simply told them what to do.</p>

## The Question/Behaviour Effect

Bartlett describes the question/behaviour effect: the simple act of being asked a question about your intentions changes your subsequent behaviour. If someone asks you "Are you going to exercise this week?" you are significantly more likely to exercise than if they hadn't asked.

This effect operates even when the question is completely neutral — no judgment, no pressure, no follow-up. The mere act of articulating an intention increases the probability of enacting it.

For leaders, this is revolutionary. Instead of mandating behaviour, ask about it. Instead of telling your team what they should do, ask them what they plan to do. The question itself does much of the work.

<h4>The Core Law</h4>
<p>Replace commands with questions. The question/behaviour effect means that the act of being asked changes what people do — without any need for directives, enforcement, or pressure.</p>
</div>

## Powerful Questions to Use

Not all questions are equally effective. Here are the categories that generate the most change:

**Future-focused questions:**
- "What will you do differently next week?"
- "How will you approach this situation when it arises?"
- "What's the one action that would make the biggest difference?"

**Self-diagnostic questions:**
- "What do you think went wrong there?"
- "What would you do if I weren't here to ask?"
- "What's the real obstacle?"

**Commitment questions:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to actually do this?"
- "What would make that a 10?"
- "What specific commitment can you make right now?"

<div class="practice-box">
<h4>The Question Shift</h4>
<p>Identify one area where you routinely give instructions or make demands of others. For the next week:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write out the instruction you would normally give</li>
<li>Rephrase it as a genuine question</li>
<li>Ask the question and resist the urge to fill the silence</li>
<li>Notice whether the response demonstrates more ownership than your instructions would have produced</li>
</ol>

## Asking in Sales and Marketing

This law extends beyond leadership into every persuasive context. The best salespeople ask questions rather than pitch features. The best marketers create interactive experiences rather than passive advertisements. The best teachers ask students to discover rather than simply delivering answers.

In each case, the question generates engagement, ownership, and commitment that no statement can achieve. The question honours the intelligence and agency of the other person — and that respect is itself powerfully persuasive.

## Key Takeaways

- Commands generate compliance; questions generate commitment and ownership
- The question/behaviour effect means being asked about intentions changes subsequent behaviour
- Self-generated answers and commitments are far more binding than externally imposed ones
- Future-focused, self-diagnostic, and commitment questions are the most powerful categories
- The principle applies to leadership, sales, parenting, teaching, and every other persuasive context
