## The One-Degree Principle

A plane that departs Los Angeles heading for New York but is one degree off course will land somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean — not New York. The error at the starting point is tiny. The consequence at the destination is catastrophic.

This is the one-degree principle, and it is one of the most important concepts for understanding how failures actually develop. They are almost never sudden. They are the accumulated result of small misalignments, minor neglect, and subtle compromises that seemed inconsequential in the moment.

When a business collapses, a relationship breaks down, a project fails, or a career stalls, the real origin is almost always much earlier than it appears. The visible crisis is the end of a long trajectory that could have been corrected at dozens of earlier points.

<h4>Error Compounding</h4>
<p>In complex systems, small errors don't just persist — they compound. A slight misalignment in a manufacturing process creates defects that create customer complaints that create returns that create financial strain that create cost-cutting that create more quality problems. The feedback loop accelerates the divergence from the intended trajectory over time.</p>
</div>

## Why Small Misses Are So Dangerous

Small misses are dangerous for three reasons:

**They feel acceptable.** "This isn't perfect, but it's close enough." Each individual small miss feels tolerable. It's only the accumulation — often invisible until it's serious — that becomes the problem.

**They normalise declining standards.** Every tolerated imperfection establishes a new baseline. The standard that feels normal gradually shifts downward. What would have been unacceptable six months ago becomes the new acceptable.

**They create momentum in the wrong direction.** It is much easier to maintain high standards than to restore them once they've slipped. The small miss creates friction against correction, and the longer it persists, the more friction increases.

<div class="law-box">
<h4>The Core Law</h4>
<p>Develop the discipline to catch small misses early and correct them immediately. The cost of early correction is always a fraction of the cost of late correction — and late correction is always the only remaining option if early correction is repeatedly deferred.</p>
</div>

## Early Warning Systems

The most valuable leadership skill in light of this law is the ability to detect early signals of misalignment — to see the one-degree error before it becomes a crisis.

This requires:
- **Regular review disciplines** — systematic check-ins that ask not just "are we hitting targets?" but "are we on the right trajectory?"
- **The courage to name small problems** — cultures where small misses are surfaced are far healthier than cultures where they are minimised
- **Lagging vs. leading indicators** — tracking indicators that predict future problems rather than merely confirming past results

<div class="practice-box">
<h4>The Trajectory Review</h4>
<p>Choose one important domain of your work or life — a project, a relationship, a habit, a business metric. Ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the current trajectory, if things continue exactly as they are?</li>
<li>Are there any small misses that have been accumulating but feel "acceptable"?</li>
<li>What is the one-degree correction needed right now to redirect the trajectory?</li>
<li>What would this situation look like in 6-12 months if no correction is made?</li>
</ol>
</div>

## The Correction Window

Every small miss has a correction window. Early in the compounding process, correction is easy — a small adjustment restores the trajectory. As time passes, the cost of correction escalates because the effects have compounded and the culture around the miss has normalised.

The most expensive thing any organisation or person can do is identify a small problem and decide to address it later. Later arrives with compound interest.

## Key Takeaways

- Small errors compound — the one-degree principle shows that tiny misalignments create catastrophic consequences over distance
- Small misses feel acceptable individually but normalise declining standards collectively over time
- The cost of early correction is always a fraction of the cost of late correction
- Cultures that surface small problems early are exponentially healthier than cultures that minimise them
- Every small miss has a correction window — delay increases both the cost and difficulty of correction
