## Understanding the Gita

**Total: 18 Chapters | 700 Verses**

The Bhagavad Gita presents a sacred dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. It explores dharma, karma, self-knowledge, and devotion through a progressive teaching that moves from confusion to clarity and surrender.

This mind map organizes all 18 chapters into three arcs: foundations of self and action, knowledge of the Absolute and devotion, and the final path to liberation through disciplined living and wholehearted surrender.
