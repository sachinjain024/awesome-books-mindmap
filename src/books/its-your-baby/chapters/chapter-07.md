## The New Risk Landscape

Modern parenting includes challenges previous generations did not face at this intensity: screen overexposure, processed foods, reduced outdoor play, and pollution. The chapter reframes these as modifiable risks rather than unavoidable realities.

## Screen Hygiene in Early Years

Excess screen exposure is linked to poorer sleep, language delay risk, and reduced attention. The book recommends age-appropriate boundaries, caregiver-led interaction, and screen-free routines around sleep and meals.

## Nutrition and Activity Patterns

Early feeding habits shape taste, metabolism, and long-term weight trends. Parents are encouraged to prioritize whole foods, reduce sugar dependence, and normalize movement and play as part of daily routine.

## Key Takeaways

- Lifestyle habits formed early often persist into later childhood
- Screens should be intentional, limited, and developmentally appropriate
- Family food culture influences obesity risk more than occasional treats
- Consistent routines outperform one-time corrective efforts
