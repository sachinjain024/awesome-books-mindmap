## Milestones as Guidance, Not Competition

The chapter explains gross motor, fine motor, language, and social milestones as developmental ranges. Parents are encouraged to monitor progress trends rather than compare children rigidly.

## Everyday Brain-Building

Talking, eye contact, touch, play, and predictable caregiving strengthen neural pathways in the first two years. Repetition and responsive interaction are highlighted as the foundation for learning and emotional security.

## When to Seek Assessment

Persistent delays in movement, communication, eye contact, or social responsiveness should be discussed early with a pediatrician. Early intervention improves outcomes and reduces long-term complications.

## Key Takeaways

- Milestones should be tracked as patterns over time
- Daily interaction is the strongest early developmental input
- Early detection matters more than delayed reassurance
- Parents can support development through ordinary routines
