> "Prevention is the most loving form of pediatric care."
> — Dr. Saroja Balan

## Why Prevention Comes First

The chapter positions preventive care as the backbone of child health. Regular pediatric reviews identify nutrition, growth, developmental, and risk issues before they become serious.

## Vaccination Confidence

Parents are guided through the logic of immunization schedules, expected minor reactions, and common myths. The book emphasizes that vaccines protect both individual children and community health.

## Growth Monitoring and Counseling

Routine checkups are not just for illness. They provide opportunities to review feeding, sleep, developmental progress, oral care, and safety planning at each stage.

## Key Takeaways

- Vaccine adherence prevents severe, avoidable disease
- Follow-up visits are for optimization, not only emergencies
- Mild post-vaccine symptoms are often expected and manageable
- Reliable medical guidance should outweigh rumor-driven decisions
