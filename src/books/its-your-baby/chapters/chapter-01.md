## The First Transition

The arrival of a baby changes every routine in the home. Sleep patterns shift, decisions feel urgent, and advice comes from all directions. This chapter grounds parents in a realistic starting point: uncertainty is normal, and confidence grows through observation and consistency.

## Building a Safe Beginning

Early care should prioritize feeding, warmth, hygiene, and emotional bonding. Skin-to-skin contact, responsive holding, and gentle routines support both physical regulation and attachment. Parents are encouraged to trust daily signals from the baby instead of overreacting to isolated events.

## Family Systems and Support

New parent stress often comes from fatigue and conflicting guidance. The chapter recommends assigning practical roles among caregivers, limiting unhelpful input, and maintaining communication between partners and grandparents.

## Key Takeaways

- Early parenting is a learning phase, not a performance test
- Stability in basic routines improves infant comfort and parental confidence
- Emotional availability matters as much as technical care
- A coordinated support system reduces avoidable stress
