> "A crying baby needs interpretation, not panic."
> — Dr. Saroja Balan

## Normal Infant Sleep

Newborn sleep is fragmented and biologically different from adult sleep. This chapter helps parents set realistic expectations, avoid over-comparison, and build gentle day-night cues through light exposure, feeding rhythm, and calming bedtime transitions.

## Reading Cries with Context

Crying can signal hunger, overstimulation, discomfort, gas, fatigue, or need for contact. Instead of treating every cry as illness, parents are advised to evaluate timing, recent feeds, temperature, and behavior patterns.

## Soothing Strategies

Responsive soothing includes holding, rocking, burping, swaddling when age-appropriate, and lowering sensory load. The chapter reinforces that co-regulation is developmental, not a bad habit.

## Key Takeaways

- Irregular sleep is expected in early infancy
- Crying is communication and must be interpreted in context
- Calm caregiver response shortens distress cycles
- Simple routines improve sleep quality over time
