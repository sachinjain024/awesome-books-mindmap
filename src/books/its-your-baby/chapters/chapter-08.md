## Decision-Making Under Stress

Parents often struggle with two opposite mistakes: rushing to emergency care for minor symptoms or delaying consultation during serious illness. This chapter provides a balanced framework for escalation.

## Red Flags That Need Immediate Attention

Persistent high fever in very young infants, breathing difficulty, poor feeding with low urine output, unusual drowsiness, recurrent vomiting, seizures, and signs of dehydration are treated as urgent indicators.

## Practical Escalation Pathway

The chapter recommends documenting symptom timeline, temperature records, medication doses, and feeding/urine patterns before consultation. This improves clinical decisions and reduces diagnostic delay.

## Key Takeaways

- Confidence comes from criteria, not guesswork
- Urgent signs must override social reassurance or online advice
- Good symptom tracking improves quality of care
- Parents should trust concern when a child appears significantly different from baseline
