## About This Book

**It's Your Baby** is a practical parenting guide designed for families navigating pregnancy, newborn care, and the first two years of life. Written in a direct, reassuring style, the book focuses on what new parents actually need in daily life: feeding decisions, sleep routines, common illnesses, vaccines, hygiene, and knowing when medical attention is necessary.

This mind map organizes the book into eight actionable chapters so parents can quickly find guidance during real situations, not just read theory. The goal is to reduce fear, build judgment, and help families raise healthier children with confidence.
