            <h2>Not All Praise Is Created Equal</h2>
            <p>We're often told to praise children more. But the type of praise matters enormously. Evaluative praise - "Good job!" "You're so smart!" "What a good boy!" - can actually be counterproductive. It creates dependence on external validation and can feel hollow or even manipulative to children.</p>

            <p>Descriptive praise, on the other hand, helps children develop an accurate, positive picture of themselves. Instead of telling children what to think about themselves, we describe what we see and let them draw their own conclusions.</p>

            <h4>The Problem with Evaluative Praise</h4>
            <p><strong>"You're so smart!"</strong> - Children praised for being smart often become afraid to take risks. They think: "If I fail, I won't be smart anymore."</p>
            <p><strong>"Good job!"</strong> - Overused, this becomes meaningless background noise. Children learn to dismiss it.</p>
            <p><strong>"You're the best!"</strong> - Creates pressure to maintain an impossible standard and compete with others.</p>
            <p><strong>"I'm so proud of you!"</strong> - While okay occasionally, it can make children work for your approval rather than their own satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>Three Types of Helpful Praise</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-box">
            <h3>Type 1: Describe What You See</h3>
            <div class="skill-steps">
                <li>Simply describe what you observe</li>
                <li>Be specific about details</li>
                <li>Leave out evaluative words like "good," "great," "beautiful"</li>
                <li>Let the child evaluate their own work</li>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="comparison">
            <div class="comparison-item dont">
                <h4>Instead of:</h4>
                <p>"What a beautiful picture! You're such a great artist!"</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-item do">
                <h4>Try:</h4>
                <p>"I see you used lots of bright colors here. There are purple mountains and a yellow sun, and you put a house with a red door right in the middle."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-dialogue">
            <h4>The Child's Response to Description</h4>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> I see you organized your entire bookshelf. The books are arranged by size, and you found a place for all your trophies.
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line child">
                <span class="speaker">Child:</span> Yeah! It looks so much better now. I worked really hard on it.
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-style: italic; color: #64748b;">Notice: The child supplies their own evaluation - "I worked really hard on it" - which is more meaningful than a parent saying "Good job!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-box">
            <h3>Type 2: Describe What You Feel</h3>
            <div class="skill-steps">
                <li>Share your genuine emotional response</li>
                <li>Be authentic - children can tell when you're faking</li>
                <li>This shows children their actions have positive impact</li>
                <li>Use "I" language</li>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-dialogue">
            <h4>Examples of Describing Feelings</h4>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> It's such a pleasure to walk into a clean kitchen! I feel relaxed when things are tidy.
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> I really enjoyed listening to you practice piano. That song always makes me feel happy.
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> I felt so touched when you shared your snack with your sister without being asked.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="skill-box">
            <h3>Type 3: Sum Up the Behavior in a Word</h3>
            <div class="skill-steps">
                <li>After describing, name the quality you observed</li>
                <li>This gives children vocabulary for their strengths</li>
                <li>Use words like: perseverance, courage, creativity, thoughtfulness</li>
                <li>The description + word creates a lasting self-image</li>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-dialogue">
            <h4>Examples of Summing Up</h4>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> You've been working on that math problem for twenty minutes. You tried different approaches and didn't give up. That's perseverance.
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> You noticed your friend was sitting alone and went over to include her. That's thoughtfulness.
            </div>
            <div class="dialogue-line parent">
                <span class="speaker">Parent:</span> You saved half your allowance every week for two months to buy that game. That took real self-discipline.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            <div class="technique-name">The Complete Formula</div>
            <div class="technique-description">
                <p><strong>1. Describe what you see:</strong> "You organized all your toys by type - cars here, blocks here, stuffed animals on the shelf..."</p>
                <p><strong>2. Describe what you feel:</strong> "It feels so good to walk in and see everything in its place."</p>
                <p><strong>3. Sum it up:</strong> "That's what I call organization!"</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Result:</strong> The child thinks: "I organized well. My room makes people feel good. I can be organized."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Praise and Self-Esteem</h2>
            <p>True self-esteem comes from accurate self-knowledge, not inflated compliments. When we describe specifically what a child has done, we help them build a realistic, positive picture of their abilities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Evaluative praise:</strong> "You're so smart!" → Child thinks: "Am I really? What if I fail next time?"</li>
                <li><strong>Descriptive praise:</strong> "You figured out that puzzle by trying different pieces until you found the right fit." → Child thinks: "I'm someone who keeps trying until I solve problems."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When Praise Backfires</h2>
            <p>Be careful with praise when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>It doesn't match reality:</strong> A child who knows their work isn't great will distrust your judgment</li>
                <li><strong>It creates pressure:</strong> "You're the best soccer player!" can make children anxious about maintaining status</li>
                <li><strong>It compares:</strong> "You're better than your brother at this" sets up sibling rivalry</li>
                <li><strong>It focuses on the person, not the process:</strong> "You're a natural!" undermines the value of effort</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h4>The Descriptive Praise Checklist</h4>
            <p>Before praising, ask yourself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Am I describing what I actually see?</li>
                <li>Am I being specific?</li>
                <li>Am I avoiding evaluative words?</li>
                <li>Will this help my child know themselves better?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Takeaways from Chapter 5</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Describe, don't evaluate:</strong> "I see..." instead of "Good job!"</li>
                <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Details make praise meaningful and believable</li>
                <li><strong>Share your feelings:</strong> "I feel..." shows the impact of their actions</li>
                <li><strong>Name the quality:</strong> "That's perseverance" gives vocabulary for strengths</li>
                <li><strong>Let children evaluate themselves:</strong> They'll trust their own conclusions more</li>
                <li><strong>Praise effort and process:</strong> Not just outcomes or innate traits</li>
            </ul>
