## About This Mind Map

This mind map presents Jim Collins' groundbreaking research into what separates great companies from merely good ones. Based on a five-year study of 1,435 companies, Collins and his team identified 11 companies that made the leap from good to great and sustained that greatness for at least 15 years. This mind map distills the key findings, frameworks, and principles that enabled these transformations.
