The research revealed an unexpected finding: the leaders who presided over the good-to-great transformations were not the high-profile, celebrity executives typically celebrated in the business press. Instead, they exhibited a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will—what Collins calls Level 5 Leadership.

## The Unexpected Discovery

When the research began, Collins explicitly told his team to downplay the role of leadership. He didn't want another book about charismatic leaders. But the data forced an unexpected conclusion: leadership mattered enormously—just not the kind of leadership they expected.

> "Level 5 leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company. It's not that Level 5 leaders have no ego or self-interest. Indeed, they are incredibly ambitious—but their ambition is first and foremost for the institution, not themselves."
> — Jim Collins

## The Five Levels of Leadership

Collins developed a hierarchy of leadership capabilities, with Level 5 at the apex:

### The Leadership Hierarchy {.hierarchy-box}

**Level 5: Level 5 Executive** — Builds enduring greatness through personal humility + professional will

**Level 4: Effective Leader** — Catalyzes commitment to a compelling vision; stimulates high performance

**Level 3: Competent Manager** — Organizes people and resources toward effective pursuit of objectives

**Level 2: Contributing Team Member** — Contributes individual capabilities; works well in groups

**Level 1: Highly Capable Individual** — Productive through talent, knowledge, skills, and good work habits

Level 5 is not simply an addition to the other four levels—it represents a qualitative shift. Level 5 leaders possess all the capabilities of the lower levels but channel them in a unique way.

## The Two Sides of Level 5

Level 5 leaders embody a paradoxical combination of seemingly contradictory traits:

### The Level 5 Paradox {.comparison-box}

**Personal Humility:**
- Demonstrates compelling modesty
- Acts with quiet determination
- Channels ambition into the company
- Gives credit to others for success
- Looks in the mirror when things go wrong

**Professional Will:**
- Creates superb results
- Demonstrates unwavering resolve
- Sets the standard of building greatness
- Looks out the window to give credit
- Takes responsibility for poor results

## The Window and the Mirror

Collins observed a distinctive pattern in how Level 5 leaders attributed success and failure:

### The Window and Mirror Concept {.concept-box}

**When things go well:** Level 5 leaders look out the window to find and give credit to factors outside themselves—other people, good fortune, or external circumstances.

**When things go poorly:** They look in the mirror and take responsibility, never blaming bad luck or other people.

Comparison company executives did the opposite—they looked in the mirror to take credit for success and out the window to assign blame for failure.

## Darwin Smith: The Quintessential Level 5

Darwin Smith, CEO of Kimberly-Clark from 1971 to 1991, exemplifies Level 5 leadership. When he took over, Kimberly-Clark was a stodgy paper company. He made the bold decision to sell the mills and compete directly against Procter & Gamble in consumer paper products.

### Darwin Smith's Leadership {.case-study}

- Made one of the boldest decisions in business history—selling traditional mills to fund consumer products
- When diagnosed with cancer, didn't retire but doubled down on his work
- Never cultivated his own fame or hero status
- Under his leadership, Kimberly-Clark beat P&G in 6 of 8 product categories
- Generated stock returns 4.1x the general market during his tenure

## Can Level 5 Be Developed?

Collins addresses whether Level 5 leadership can be learned or if it's an innate trait. While the research can't definitively answer this, it suggests that some combination of nature and nurture is at work.

### Developing Level 5 Traits {.principle-box}

Two categories of people might develop Level 5 capabilities:

1. **Those with the seed:** People who have the capability latent within them, which can be cultivated under the right circumstances

2. **Those shaped by experience:** People who develop humility through significant life experiences—near-death experiences, crises, mentors, or great teachers

### The Comparison Leaders {.warning-box}

In contrast, many comparison company leaders displayed the opposite traits: personal ego-driven ambition, blame-shifting when things went wrong, and a focus on their own reputation over company success. Some were genuinely talented, but their focus on themselves rather than the institution prevented sustained greatness.

## Key Takeaways

- Level 5 leaders combine extreme personal humility with intense professional will
- They are ambitious—but for the company, not themselves
- The "Window and Mirror" pattern: credit others for success, take responsibility for failure
- Level 5 leadership can potentially be developed, though some may have it innately
- Celebrity, larger-than-life leaders were negatively correlated with good-to-great transformations
