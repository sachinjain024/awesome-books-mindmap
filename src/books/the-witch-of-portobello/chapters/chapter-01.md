## The Longing for a Child

Samira Khalil had always desired a child, yet motherhood did not come easily. As she grew older, the ache of unfulfilled longing became a constant companion. When she finally learned that a child from Transylvania needed adoption, something stirred in her—a recognition that fate was offering her what love alone could not create. She did not know then that this little girl would eventually become known as the Witch of Portobello, nor did she suspect that motherhood would be the gateway to understanding the divine feminine in ways she never imagined.

When young Sherine arrived from Transylvania, she was already different. There was an intensity in her eyes, a quality of presence that made Samira pause. The girl was not like other children. She moved through the world as though touching invisible threads, aware of things that ordinary children could not perceive. From the beginning, Samira sensed that her daughter was destined for something beyond the ordinary.

### The Challenge of Raising a Goddess {.goddess-teaching}

Mothering Athena was not the experience Samira had anticipated. Traditional approaches to parenting seemed to slip through her fingers when applied to this child. Athena questioned everything—not with the stubbornness of a rebel, but with the genuine curiosity of someone who sensed there were deeper truths beneath the surface of accepted reality. She refused to be contained by convention, and her mother found herself caught between protecting her and honoring the fierce spirit that could not be tamed.

Samira watched as her daughter grew, and she began to understand that the longing that had brought Athena into her life was not just about motherhood—it was about witnessing the emergence of something sacred. When Athena would dance alone in her room, moving to music only she could hear, Samira recognized it as more than childhood play. It was as though her daughter was conversing with invisible presences, channeling energies that belonged to a realm beyond ordinary perception.

## The Question of Origins

One of the greatest sorrows Samira carried was knowing that she had not given Athena life, and therefore could not fully understand the origins of her daughter's extraordinary nature. Where did this intensity come from? What combination of ancestry, soul purpose, and divine intention had created someone so fundamentally different from the people around her?

The question of origins haunted Samira throughout her life with Athena. She wondered if the spiritual gifts her daughter possessed came from her biological parents, from the gypsy heritage Athena claimed with pride, or from something even more fundamental—perhaps Athena had simply chosen to incarnate with these gifts, to fulfill a destiny that transcended family bloodlines.

### A Mother's Acceptance {.perspective-box}

Despite her uncertainties, Samira learned to step aside and allow her daughter's true nature to emerge. This was perhaps the greatest act of love—not trying to shape Athena into the daughter she had imagined, but accepting that her child was a vessel through which something greater was flowing. In the end, Samira became the guardian of Athena's earliest days, the one who witnessed her awakening and did not try to suppress it.

## The Spiritual Legacy

Samira understood, perhaps more deeply than anyone, that Athena's journey was never really about becoming a spiritual teacher or prophet. It was about returning home to the truth that had always lived within her—the truth that the divine feminine, Hagia Sophia, was not distant or abstract, but living and breathing through her very flesh and movement.

As a mother, Samira's role was to provide the foundation from which her daughter could soar. Though she could not fully explain or control what Athena would become, she gave her daughter the greatest gift any parent can offer: the freedom to find her own truth, and the love that asks no questions but simply accepts.

The longing that had brought Athena into Samira's life transformed into a different kind of longing as the years progressed—a longing to understand, to accept, and ultimately, to honor the mystery that her daughter embodied. In the end, Samira became not just a mother, but a humble witness to the emergence of the divine feminine in human form.
