<div class="intro">
            <p>Jonathan returns to the same shore where he was once outcast. He finds gulls who are ready to learn—who are tired of only eating and surviving. He teaches them to fly, to see their freedom, and to forgive the flock that cast them out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Students Who See</h2>
            <p>Not every gull is interested. Jonathan looks for those with a "gleam in the eye"—the ones who already question the old way. He teaches them that they are free, that they can fly faster and higher, and that the only law that matters is love.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Forgiveness</h2>
            <p>Jonathan tells his students not to blame the flock for casting them out. The flock doesn't know any better; they are doing what they were taught. The work is to transcend—and then to forgive, and to keep loving.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Growth doesn't require condemning those who stayed behind. Forgiveness and love allow you to rise without carrying resentment—and to leave the door open for others when they're ready.</p>

            <h2>Fletcher and the Legacy</h2>
            <p>Fletcher Lynd Seagull, once outcast for accidently hitting the Elder, becomes Jonathan's devoted student. When Jonathan moves on, he leaves Fletcher with the same mission: find the ones who are ready, and help them see that they are free.</p>
