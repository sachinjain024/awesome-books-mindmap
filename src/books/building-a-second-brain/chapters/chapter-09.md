## The Maintenance Problem

Every system — no matter how well designed — requires maintenance. A Second Brain that you set up once and never tend to will gradually become cluttered, outdated, and untrustworthy. When you can't trust that your notes are current and organized, you stop relying on the system. And when you stop relying on the system, you fall back on your biological brain — with all its limitations.

The answer is not to spend hours every week reorganizing your entire Second Brain. It's to develop a set of lightweight, regular habits that keep the system accurate and useful with minimal effort.

Forte identifies three maintenance routines — the Project Checklist, the Weekly Review, and the Monthly Review — that together keep a Second Brain alive and working.

## Habit 1: The Project Checklist

The Project Checklist is a set of actions you take whenever a project starts or ends. It takes only a few minutes but makes a significant difference in how well your Second Brain serves you.

### Starting a Project {.practice-box}

When beginning a new project:

1. **Capture** your current thinking — what do you already know? What are your initial assumptions?
2. **Review** your Second Brain for relevant material from past projects and resources
3. **Search** for relevant Intermediate Packets (notes, outlines, drafts) already in your system
4. **Move** relevant notes from other folders into the project's folder
5. **Create** an outline or plan for the project

This ritual ensures every project starts with your best available thinking — not from a blank slate.

### Completing a Project {.practice-box}

When finishing a project:

1. **Mark** the project as complete in your task manager
2. **Cross-reference** any remaining open tasks or follow-ups
3. **Review** notes in the project folder — what's worth keeping for future use?
4. **Move** anything reusable to appropriate Areas or Resources folders
5. **Archive** the entire project folder
6. **Write** a brief "lessons learned" note — what worked, what didn't, what you'd do differently

This completion ritual extracts the maximum value from your investment in the project and preserves Intermediate Packets for future use.

## Habit 2: The Weekly Review

The Weekly Review is borrowed from David Allen's Getting Things Done methodology but adapted for the Second Brain context. It's a 30–60 minute ritual (typically done Friday afternoon or Sunday evening) that ensures everything in your system is current.

### The Weekly Review Process {.technique-box}

1. **Clear your inbox:** Process any outstanding notes, emails, or captures into your PARA system
2. **Review active projects:** For each active project, are you on track? Do you need to capture anything? Is there a next action?
3. **Update your task list:** Add, complete, or reorganize tasks as needed
4. **Review your Areas:** Are you maintaining the standards you want in each area of responsibility?
5. **File or archive:** Move anything that's settled or completed to its appropriate folder
6. **Plan the upcoming week:** What are your priorities? What Intermediate Packets will you need?

The Weekly Review is not a deep cleaning — it's a light maintenance pass that prevents small messes from becoming large ones.

### The Value of Regularity {.insight-box}

The magic of the Weekly Review is not any individual session but the **compounding effect over time**. Each review is relatively quick because you're dealing with only one week's worth of entropy. But the regularity means your system is *always* approximately current — and an approximately current system is one you can trust.

## Habit 3: The Monthly Review

The Monthly Review is a more thorough examination of your Second Brain, conducted once a month. Where the Weekly Review is about keeping current, the Monthly Review is about ensuring the system still reflects your actual life and goals.

### The Monthly Review Process {.technique-box}

1. **Review your goals:** Are your active Projects still the right projects? Have priorities shifted?
2. **Review all Projects:** Are there any that should be archived? Any that should be started?
3. **Review all Areas:** Are your Areas still relevant? Do any need new projects to support them?
4. **Review Resources:** Are there any that have become relevant enough to move to Projects or Areas?
5. **Review Archives:** Sometimes a completed project yields follow-up work — this is the time to notice it
6. **Intentional capture:** Are there topics or questions you should be capturing more of?

The Monthly Review is where strategic alignment happens. It ensures that your Second Brain is not just organized but organized around what *actually* matters to you right now.

## The "Just-in-Time" Approach to Maintenance

A crucial principle underlying all three routines is **just-in-time maintenance** — doing the work when it's most relevant, not in advance of when it might be needed.

You don't reorganize your entire system every week. You reorganize the parts you're currently using. You don't distill every note when you capture it. You distill it when you're about to use it. This minimizes wasted effort and ensures the work you do is always directed toward something real.

### The 10-Minute Tidy {.practice-box}

Between scheduled reviews, Forte recommends occasional "10-minute tidies" — quick passes through your inbox or a single PARA category whenever you have a few free minutes. These micro-maintenance sessions prevent backlogs from building up and keep the system feeling manageable.

### Reflection {.reflection}

Of the three review routines — Project Checklist, Weekly Review, Monthly Review — which one feels most absent from your current practice? What would it mean for your peace of mind and productivity to run that routine consistently for 90 days?

## Key Takeaways

- A Second Brain requires regular maintenance habits to remain trustworthy and useful
- The Project Checklist ensures projects start with context and end with preserved knowledge
- The Weekly Review (30–60 min) keeps your system current and your commitments on track
- The Monthly Review ensures your system reflects your actual current goals and priorities
- The "just-in-time" principle: maintain the parts you're using, when you're using them
- Regularity matters more than depth — a consistent light review beats an occasional thorough overhaul
