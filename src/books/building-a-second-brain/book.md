  subtitle: Organize your knowledge. Unlock your creativity.

sections:
  - title: THE FOUNDATION — UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S POSSIBLE
    chapters:
      - number: 1
        title: Where It All Started
        subtitle: The Promise of a Second Brain
        description: Tiago Forte shares his personal story of struggling with a chronic illness and the information overload that followed. He explains how creating a personal knowledge management system transformed his ability to think, create, and contribute.

      - number: 2
        title: What Is a Second Brain?
        subtitle: A Digital Commonplace Book
        description: Introduces the concept of a Second Brain — a trusted digital repository for capturing, organizing, and retrieving the ideas and insights that matter most. Draws on the historical tradition of the commonplace book used by Leonardo da Vinci, Virginia Woolf, and others.

      - number: 3
        title: How a Second Brain Works
        subtitle: Remembering, Connecting, Creating
        description: Explains the three core capabilities a Second Brain provides — remembering beyond our biological limits, making unexpected connections between ideas, and creating from a rich reservoir of knowledge. Introduces the CODE framework as the organizing method.

  - title: THE METHOD — THE FOUR STEPS OF CODE
    chapters:
      - number: 4
        title: Capture — Keep What Resonates
        subtitle: Save the Best of What You Encounter
        description: The first step of CODE — how to capture only the most resonant information from books, articles, podcasts, and conversations. Introduces the "capture criteria" and explains why capturing less is more effective than capturing everything.

      - number: 5
        title: Organize — Save for Actionability
        subtitle: The PARA Method
        description: The second step of CODE — how to organize captured information using the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives). Explains why organizing by actionability rather than topic is the key insight that makes everything work.

      - number: 6
        title: Distill — Find the Essence
        subtitle: Progressive Summarization
        description: The third step of CODE — how to distill notes to their essential points using Progressive Summarization. This layered highlighting technique helps you find the most important ideas quickly, no matter when you return to a note.

      - number: 7
        title: Express — Show Your Work
        subtitle: The Intermediate Packets Approach
        description: The fourth and final step of CODE — how to express your knowledge through creative output. Introduces the concept of Intermediate Packets — small, reusable units of work that allow you to build creative projects incrementally and ship consistently.

  - title: THE SHIFT — MAKING THINGS HAPPEN
    chapters:
      - number: 8
        title: The Art of Creative Execution
        subtitle: The Divergence and Convergence of Ideas
        description: Explains how creative work alternates between divergence (gathering raw material) and convergence (narrowing toward a finished product). Offers the techniques of the Archipelago of Ideas, the Hemingway Bridge, and Dial Down the Scope to help you ship creative work.

      - number: 9
        title: The Essential Habits of Digital Organizers
        subtitle: Project, Weekly, and Monthly Reviews
        description: Covers the maintenance habits that keep a Second Brain functional and alive — the Project Checklist, the Weekly Review, and the Monthly Review. Explains how these routines help you stay on top of your commitments without relying on memory.

      - number: 10
        title: The Path of Self-Expression
        subtitle: Your Knowledge Wants to Be Shared
        description: The culminating chapter calls readers to recognize their unique perspective and knowledge as a gift worth sharing. Explores the creative courage required to move from private notes to public expression, and the broader impact a Second Brain can have on your life.

keyTeachings:
  - principle: "CODE — The Four Steps:"
    description: Capture (collect what resonates), Organize (structure for action), Distill (find the essence), Express (share your work). This is the complete cycle of personal knowledge management.

  - principle: "PARA — Organize by Actionability:"
    description: Projects (active goals with deadlines), Areas (ongoing responsibilities), Resources (topics of interest), Archives (inactive items). Store information where you'll need it, not where it came from.

  - principle: "Progressive Summarization:"
    description: Highlight the most important passages, then bold the most important of those, then summarize at the top. You can find the essence of any note in seconds, years later.

  - principle: "Intermediate Packets:"
    description: Break creative work into small, reusable pieces. Each note, outline, or draft is an Intermediate Packet that can be reassembled across projects and over time.

  - principle: "Just-in-Time vs. Just-in-Case:"
    description: Stop capturing information just in case you need it someday. Capture only what resonates — what feels useful for your current projects and goals.

  - principle: "Diverge, Then Converge:"
    description: Creative work has two modes — divergence (open exploration) and convergence (focused execution). Keeping them separate prevents the most common creative blocks.

## About This Book

**Building a Second Brain** by Tiago Forte is the definitive guide to personal knowledge management in the digital age. At its core, the book argues that our minds are for having ideas, not storing them. By building a trusted external system — a "Second Brain" — we can offload the burden of remembering everything and free our cognitive resources for deeper thinking and greater creativity.

Forte's system is built around a simple but powerful acronym: **CODE** — Capture, Organize, Distill, Express. These four steps form a complete cycle for turning the information you consume every day into tangible creative output, whether that's a project at work, a blog post, a book, or simply a better conversation.

The book also introduces **PARA**, a flexible organizational system that sorts everything you save — notes, files, documents — into four categories based on how actionable they are: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. Unlike traditional filing systems organized by topic, PARA is organized by your life and work, making it natural and intuitive.

## Why This Mind Map

This mind map distills Forte's methodology into its most essential components. Each chapter builds on the last — from understanding the need for a Second Brain, to mastering the four steps of CODE, to developing the habits that sustain the system long-term. Whether you're new to personal knowledge management or looking to refine an existing system, this guide provides a structured entry point into one of the most transformative productivity frameworks of the digital era.
