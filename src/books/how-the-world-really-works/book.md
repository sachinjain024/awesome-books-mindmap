  title: HOW THE WORLD REALLY WORKS
  subtitle: A scientist's guide to our past, present and future

sections:
  - title: THE FOUNDATIONS OF CIVILIZATION
    chapters:
      - number: 1
        title: Understanding Energy
        subtitle: The Master Resource That Runs Everything
        description: Energy is the universal currency of civilization. Smil shows how our total dependence on fossil fuels is far deeper than most people realize, and why the energy transition will take decades, not years.

      - number: 2
        title: Making Our Food
        subtitle: How We Feed Eight Billion People
        description: Modern agriculture is fundamentally an energy conversion enterprise. Smil reveals the staggering fossil fuel inputs - from fertilizers to machinery to transport - that underpin the global food system.

      - number: 3
        title: Making Our Material World
        subtitle: The Four Pillars of Modern Civilization
        description: Steel, cement, plastics, and ammonia are the four materials that make modern civilization possible. Smil explains why each remains irreplaceable and how dependent we are on their continued production.

  - title: GLOBAL SYSTEMS
    chapters:
      - number: 4
        title: Globalization
        subtitle: How the World Moves
        description: The extraordinary scale and complexity of global trade is examined through the lens of shipping, aviation, and supply chains. Smil argues that deglobalization would be far more disruptive than commonly assumed.

      - number: 5
        title: Understanding Risks
        subtitle: What We Fear vs. What Should Actually Worry Us
        description: Humans are notoriously poor at assessing real versus imagined risks. Smil compares the actual probability and impact of various risks - from pandemics to terrorism to climate change - with how the public perceives them.

  - title: OUR PLANETARY FUTURE
    chapters:
      - number: 6
        title: Understanding Our Environment
        subtitle: The State of Our Planet
        description: A data-driven assessment of environmental challenges from air pollution to biodiversity loss to climate change. Smil insists on quantitative honesty over both alarmism and denial.

      - number: 7
        title: Making Our Future
        subtitle: What's Actually Possible
        description: Smil offers a realistic assessment of where humanity is headed. Rather than utopian promises or doomsday scenarios, he outlines what evidence-based thinking tells us about the constraints and possibilities of our future.

keyTeachings:
  - principle: "Energy is Everything:"
    description: All economic activity is ultimately a form of energy conversion. Understanding this principle is the key to understanding how modern civilization functions.

  - principle: "Fossil Fuel Dependence is Deep:"
    description: Our reliance on fossil fuels goes far beyond electricity generation. It is embedded in food production, materials manufacturing, and virtually every product we use.

  - principle: "The Four Pillars of Civilization:"
    description: Steel, cement, plastics, and ammonia are irreplaceable foundations of modern life. No renewable energy transition can succeed without addressing how these are produced.

  - principle: "Quantitative Literacy Matters:"
    description: Orders of magnitude matter. The difference between a million and a billion is a thousandfold - and failing to grasp such differences leads to profoundly mistaken beliefs about the world.

  - principle: "Risk Perception is Biased:"
    description: Humans systematically overestimate dramatic, rare risks (terrorism, plane crashes) while underestimating chronic, statistical risks (poor diet, car accidents).

  - principle: "Transitions Take Time:"
    description: All major energy and economic transitions in history have taken 50-100 years. Expecting rapid decarbonization without acknowledging physical and economic constraints is unrealistic.

## About This Book

*How the World Really Works* by Vaclav Smil is a bracing corrective to the wishful thinking and narrative shortcuts that dominate public discourse about energy, food, technology, and the environment. Smil - one of the most prolific and rigorous scientists writing today, and a favorite of Bill Gates - brings his trademark quantitative approach to the most urgent questions facing civilization.

The book is organized around the fundamental processes that make modern life possible: where our energy comes from, how we grow and distribute food, what materials undergird our infrastructure, how global trade functions, and what risks we actually face. In each case, Smil replaces vague impressions with hard numbers, revealing a world that is simultaneously more resilient and more fragile than popular accounts suggest.

This mind map distills Smil's key arguments and data into an accessible visual format. It covers his analysis of the four irreplaceable materials of civilization (steel, cement, plastics, and ammonia), the enormous fossil fuel dependency hidden within the global food system, the gap between perceived and actual risks, and his evidence-based assessment of humanity's future. Whether you are an optimist about clean energy transitions or deeply skeptical of techno-utopian promises, Smil's data-grounded perspective will sharpen your thinking and challenge your assumptions.
