## Understanding the Book

**Total: 12 Chapters across 4 Parts**

In this provocative work, economist and scholar Meghnad Desai approaches the Bhagavad Gita not as a divine revelation but as a historical document shaped by human hands across centuries. Using textual analysis and historical context, Desai argues that the Gita was written by **three different authors** at different periods, responding to the philosophical and religious challenges of their times.

The central question: **Was the Gita a divine revelation or a human response to Buddhism's challenge to Brahmanical authority?**
