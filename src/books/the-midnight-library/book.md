## About This Mind Map

Nora Seed is full of regret. Between life and death she finds a library where every book is a different version of her life-the life if she had stayed in the band, married the man, become a glaciologist. As she tries life after life, she learns that no path is perfect-and that the only life worth living is the one we choose to live now.
