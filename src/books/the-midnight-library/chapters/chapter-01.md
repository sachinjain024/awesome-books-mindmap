<div class="intro">
            <p>Nora Seed has lost her job, her brother has cut her off, her cat has died. She feels she has failed at everything—music, love, family, work. She decides to end her life. Instead of nothingness, she wakes in a vast library. It is always midnight. She is between life and death—and she is about to be offered a chance to try other lives.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Nora's Regrets</h2>
            <p>Nora is defined by what she didn't do: she left the band before they made it; she didn't marry Dan; she didn't become a glaciologist; she didn't stay close to her brother. Regret has become a prison. She cannot see that her current life still holds possibility—she can only see what she gave up.</p>

            <h4>Key Insight</h4>
            <p>The library is a metaphor for the weight of regret—every choice we didn't make feels like a book we didn't read. But it is also a place of second chances: we can "try" other lives and learn that none is perfect.</p>
