Investors often take cues from other investors without realizing they're playing completely different games. A day trader, a retirement saver, and a hedge fund manager might all buy the same stock—but for entirely different reasons, with different time horizons, and different definitions of success.

Taking advice from someone playing a different game is dangerous because what's rational for them may be disastrous for you.

### Different Games, Different Rules {.concept-box}

Consider who might own shares of the same company:

**Day trader:** Wants a 5% gain today. Will sell tonight regardless.

**Retirement investor:** Wants growth over 30 years. Doesn't care about today's price.

**Hedge fund:** Wants to beat the market this quarter. Success measured against benchmarks.

All three are "investors," but they have nothing in common except the stock ticker.

### The Dot-Com Bubble {.story-box}

In 1999, day traders bid up tech stocks to insane valuations. Long-term investors saw this and thought, "The market is telling me these stocks are valuable." So they bought too.

But the market wasn't saying that. Day traders were playing a game of momentum and greater fools. Their actions reflected their strategy, not a genuine belief in long-term value. Long-term investors who followed them got crushed.

## How This Causes Bubbles

Bubbles often form when short-term traders bid up prices, and long-term investors interpret those prices as information about value. The sequence:

- Short-term traders buy because they expect prices to rise further (they don't care about value)
- Prices rise, which attracts more short-term traders
- Long-term investors see high prices and think "the market knows something"
- Long-term investors buy at inflated prices
- When short-term traders exit, long-term investors are left holding the bag

### Know Your Game {.principle-box}

Before making any investment decision, ask yourself:

- **What is my time horizon?** Days, years, or decades?
- **What am I optimizing for?** Growth, income, capital preservation?
- **Who am I getting signals from?** Are they playing the same game?
- **What would success look like for me?** Not what success looks like generally.

## The Media Confusion

Financial media makes this worse. Headlines don't distinguish between games. "Stock X is up 20%" doesn't tell you whether that's relevant for a day trader or a retirement investor. The same information can be meaningful to one and irrelevant to another.

### The Danger of CNBC {.warning-box}

Most financial television is entertainment optimized for traders. If you're a long-term investor watching traders react to daily price movements, you're getting signals from people playing a completely different game. Their urgency is appropriate for them but harmful for you.

## Price vs. Value

A critical distinction emerges from understanding different games:

- **Short-term traders care about price:** What will others pay tomorrow?
- **Long-term investors care about value:** What will this produce over time?

When short-term traders set prices, those prices say nothing about long-term value. Long-term investors who forget this buy high and sell low.

## Practical Applications

- **Define your game explicitly:** Write down your time horizon and goals
- **Ignore irrelevant signals:** If you're investing for 20 years, today's price doesn't matter
- **Be skeptical of advice:** Ask what game the advisor is playing
- **Avoid market commentary:** It's mostly for traders, not investors
- **Remember your strategy during volatility:** Your game hasn't changed just because prices have

## Key Takeaways

- **Everyone is playing a different game:** Time horizons, goals, and strategies vary wildly
- **Prices reflect mixed games:** Don't interpret short-term prices as long-term signals
- **Know your own game:** Be explicit about your time horizon and goals
- **Ignore irrelevant players:** Traders' actions don't inform investors' decisions
- **Bubbles come from confusion:** Long-term investors buying at short-term prices
