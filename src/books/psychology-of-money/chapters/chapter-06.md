In business and investing, a small number of events account for the majority of outcomes. You can be wrong most of the time and still be wildly successful if you catch a few big wins. The tail drives everything.

This goes against our intuition that success requires consistent brilliance. In reality, success often comes from being positioned to catch the few massive opportunities that define an era.

### Heinz Berggruen: The Art Dealer {.story-box}

Heinz Berggruen fled Nazi Germany in 1936. After World War II, he became an art dealer. By the time he died, his collection was worth over $1 billion.

How? He bought thousands of pieces of art over his career. Most were unremarkable. But a few—works by Picasso, Klee, Matisse—became worth hundreds of millions. Those few tail events made his fortune. The thousands of mediocre purchases didn't matter.

## The Venture Capital Model

Venture capitalists understand this better than anyone. Most of their investments fail completely. A few break even. But occasionally, one becomes Google or Facebook—and that single investment returns more than all the failures combined.

<div class="math-box">
<h4>The VC Math</h4>
<p>A typical VC fund might invest in 50 companies:</p>
<p>- 35 fail completely (70%)</p>
<p>- 10 return modest gains (20%)</p>
<p>- 4 do well (8%)</p>
<p>- 1 becomes a massive hit (2%)</p>
<p><strong>That single 2% winner often returns more than the entire fund's investment.</strong></p>

## This Applies to Everything

The tail-driven nature of outcomes isn't limited to investing:

- **Businesses:** Apple's iPhone accounts for most of its profits, despite making dozens of other products
- **Movies:** A few blockbusters fund entire studios; most films lose money
- **Books:** A handful of bestsellers subsidize thousands of titles that never sell
- **Careers:** A few key decisions and opportunities shape most people's trajectories

### Russell 3000 Index Example {.concept-box}

Since 1980, 40% of all public companies have lost at least 70% of their value and never recovered. The entire gain of the index came from 7% of component companies that outperformed by at least two standard deviations.

The majority of stocks are duds. The index still works because a few big winners overwhelm the losers.

## What This Means for You {.principle-box}

**1. You Don't Need to Be Right All the Time**

You can be wrong most of the time and still come out ahead if your wins are big enough. This reduces the pressure to make perfect decisions.

**2. Stay in the Game**

You can't catch a tail event if you've been knocked out. Survival matters precisely because big opportunities are rare—you need to be around when they happen.

**3. Accept Lots of Small Failures**

If most outcomes don't matter, spending energy agonizing over every small failure is a waste. Focus on staying positioned for the occasional big win.

**4. Diversify**

Since you can't predict which investments will be the tail events, owning a broad portfolio increases your odds of catching them.

### The Dangerous Assumption {.warning-box}

The trap is assuming that because a few things drive most outcomes, you can identify those things in advance. You usually can't. The solution isn't to concentrate—it's to diversify and stay patient.

## The Long Game

What defines a genius investor? Not being right more often than others. It's being positioned to capture the big wins when they come, while not being destroyed by the inevitable losses along the way.

This is why index funds work: they don't try to pick winners. They own everything, ensuring they capture whatever tail events occur—even though most of their holdings will underperform.

## Key Takeaways

- **Tail events drive outcomes:** A small number of wins account for most returns
- **You can be wrong a lot:** Success doesn't require being right most of the time
- **Stay in the game:** You need to be present when the rare big opportunities appear
- **Diversify:** Owning many things increases your odds of catching tail events
- **Accept small losses:** They're the cost of being positioned for big wins
