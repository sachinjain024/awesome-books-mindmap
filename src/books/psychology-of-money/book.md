keyTeachingsTitle: Key Themes of the Book

keyTeachings:
  - principle: "Personal History Matters:"
    description: "Your experiences with money shape your beliefs about risk, reward, and what money means. No one is crazy—they're making decisions based on their unique experiences."

  - principle: "Luck and Risk are Siblings:"
    description: "Success requires acknowledging the role of luck in your wins and risk in others' failures. Humility and compassion follow from this recognition."

  - principle: "Compounding is Counterintuitive:"
    description: "$81.5 billion of Warren Buffett's $84.5 billion net worth came after his 65th birthday. Time in the market beats timing the market."

  - principle: "Savings = Freedom:"
    description: "Your savings rate matters more than your returns. Savings without a spending goal gives you flexibility and options—the things that make you happy."

  - principle: "Reasonable > Rational:"
    description: "Making financial decisions you can stick with beats optimizing on a spreadsheet. You have to be able to sleep at night."

**Total: 20 Chapters + Postscript**

In *The Psychology of Money*, Morgan Housel shares 20 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money. The book argues that financial success is not about what you know—it's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to smart people.

The central insight: **Doing well with money has little to do with intelligence and a lot to do with behavior.**
