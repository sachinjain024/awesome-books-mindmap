sections:
  - title: PART 1 - THE IDEA
    description: Why deep work is valuable, rare, and meaningful in today's economy
    chapters:
      - number: 1
        title: Deep Work Is Valuable
        description: In the new economy, three groups will thrive - those who work with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with capital. Deep work is essential for the first two.

      - number: 2
        title: Deep Work Is Rare
        description: Despite its value, deep work is becoming increasingly rare. Open offices, instant messaging, and social media push knowledge workers toward shallow, fragmented work.

      - number: 3
        title: Deep Work Is Meaningful
        description: A deep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived. Neurological, psychological, and philosophical arguments for why depth generates meaning.

  - title: PART 2 - THE RULES
    description: Four strategies to transform your work habits and train your ability to concentrate
    chapters:
      - number: 4
        title: "Rule #1: Work Deeply"
        description: You have a finite amount of willpower. Build rituals and routines that minimize the amount of willpower necessary to transition into deep work. Choose your depth philosophy.

      - number: 5
        title: "Rule #2: Embrace Boredom"
        description: If you don't wean your mind from on-demand distraction, you'll struggle to concentrate even when you want to. Train your ability to focus like an athlete trains their body.

      - number: 6
        title: "Rule #3: Quit Social Media"
        description: Social media fragments attention and reduces capacity for concentration. Apply the craftsman approach to tool selection—adopt only tools whose benefits substantially outweigh their costs.

      - number: 7
        title: "Rule #4: Drain the Shallows"
        description: Treat shallow work with suspicion. Schedule every minute of your day, quantify depth, and ruthlessly reduce the time spent on low-value tasks that fragment your attention.

keyTeachings:
  - principle: "The Deep Work Hypothesis:"
    description: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill will thrive.

  - principle: "High-Quality Work = Time × Intensity:"
    description: The key to producing elite-level work is to spend more consecutive hours in a state of high concentration.

  - principle: "Attention Residue:"
    description: When you switch from Task A to Task B, your attention doesn't immediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about Task A. This residue is especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity.

  - principle: "The Principle of Least Resistance:"
    description: In the absence of clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors, we tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment—even if they undermine our long-term goals.

  - principle: "Busyness as Proxy for Productivity:"
    description: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive, many knowledge workers turn back toward busyness as a proxy—doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

  - principle: "The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection:"
    description: Identify the core factors that determine success in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts substantially outweigh its negative impacts.

  - principle: "Be Comfortable with Boredom:"
    description: If every moment of potential boredom is relieved with a glance at your smartphone, your brain has been rewired to the point where it's not ready for deep work.

  - principle: "Shutdown Complete:"
    description: End your workday with a shutdown ritual that ensures every incomplete task has been reviewed and captured. This frees your mind and allows proper recovery.

## About This Mind Map

Deep Work is Cal Newport's groundbreaking book on the value of focused, distraction-free work in our increasingly scattered digital age. Newport argues that the ability to perform deep work is becoming both rare and valuable—making it a superpower for those who cultivate it.

This mind map breaks down Newport's framework: first understanding **why deep work matters** (The Idea), then learning **how to actually do it** (The Rules). Each chapter offers practical strategies for training your mind to focus and producing work that matters.
