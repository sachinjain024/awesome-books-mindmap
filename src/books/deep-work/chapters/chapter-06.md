Social media and similar network tools are not neutral—they're engineered to capture and fragment your attention. Newport doesn't argue that you must quit all social media forever, but that you should apply the same rigorous evaluation to these tools that you would to any other professional tool.

## The Any-Benefit Approach

Most people adopt network tools using what Newport calls the "any-benefit approach": if a tool offers any possible benefit, they use it.

### The Problem with Any-Benefit Thinking {.warning-box}

"I might miss something important" or "What if a client tries to reach me there?" This reasoning ignores costs entirely. A tool that provides 1% benefit but costs 10% of your concentration capacity is a bad trade—but the any-benefit approach can't see this.

### The Farmer's Fallacy {.example-box}

Imagine a farmer who buys a hay baler because "it might help with hay." But he grows wheat. The baler isn't harmful, but it's not useful either—and the money could have been spent on something that actually matters. Network tools are similar: they're not neutral costs. Attention spent scrolling is attention not spent on deep work.

## The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection

Newport proposes replacing the any-benefit approach with what he calls the "craftsman approach."

### The Craftsman Approach {.formula-box}

Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.

A skilled craftsman doesn't use every tool available—they carefully select tools that serve their specific goals. A woodworker might have dozens of specialized planes but skip expensive tools that don't suit their work. Knowledge workers should apply the same selectivity.

### The Key Question {.insight-box}

For each network tool, ask: "Does the positive impact on things I value substantially outweigh the negative impact on my ability to concentrate and produce high-quality work?" If not, quit it—even if it provides some benefit.

## Apply the Law of the Vital Few

Newport draws on the Pareto Principle (the 80/20 rule): in many areas, 80% of outcomes come from 20% of causes.

### The Goal-Based Evaluation Process {.practice-box}

1. **Identify your high-level goals** in both professional and personal life (limit to 2-3 in each area)
2. **List the 2-3 most important activities** that help you achieve each goal
3. **Evaluate each network tool**: Does it have a substantially positive, negative, or neutral impact on these activities?
4. **Keep a tool only if** it has substantial positive impact that outweighs negatives

### Applying the Process {.example-box}

**Professional Goal:** Produce high-quality research papers.

**Key Activities:** (1) Read deeply in my field, (2) Write with intense concentration, (3) Get feedback from serious colleagues.

**Evaluating Twitter:** Does it substantially help with any of these? Probably not. Does it fragment attention needed for #2? Almost certainly. Decision: quit.

## Quit Social Media (For 30 Days)

For those unsure whether social media truly hurts their deep work capacity, Newport proposes an experiment.

### The 30-Day Experiment {.strategy-box}

1. Quit all social media for 30 days—no announcement, just stop using them
2. After 30 days, ask two questions for each service:
   - Would the last 30 days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service?
   - Did people care that I wasn't using this service?
3. If both answers are "no," quit permanently. If both are "yes," return to it. Otherwise, lean toward quitting.

### What You'll Likely Discover {.insight-box}

Most people find that (1) life without social media isn't as hard as they expected, (2) very few people notice or care about their absence, and (3) their capacity for concentration improves noticeably. The services were providing less value—and costing more attention—than they realized.

## Don't Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

Beyond work, how you spend your leisure time affects your capacity for deep work. The "mental residue" from mindless browsing persists into your work sessions.

> "Put more thought into your leisure time. If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout all your waking hours, you'll end the day more fulfilled, and begin the next one more relaxed, than if you instead allow your mind to bathe for hours in semiconscious and unstructured web surfing."
> — Cal Newport

### Structure Your Leisure {.practice-box}

1. Schedule specific activities for evenings and weekends in advance
2. Include both relaxing and active options (reading, exercise, hobbies)
3. The structure reduces the pull of "default" entertainment (browsing, social media)
4. Structured leisure is more restorative than passive consumption

### Arnold Bennett's Advice {.insight-box}

Newport cites early 20th century writer Arnold Bennett: your evenings and weekends are "another day within a day." Most people waste this time on passive entertainment when they could be developing skills, enjoying hobbies, or engaging meaningfully with family and friends. Structured use of free time is both more satisfying and better prepares your mind for deep work.

## Key Takeaways

- The "any-benefit" approach to tool adoption ignores costs. Most network tools cost more in attention than they provide in value.
- Apply the craftsman approach: adopt tools only if their benefits to your core goals substantially outweigh their costs.
- Use the Law of the Vital Few: identify your most important goals and activities, then evaluate tools against these.
- Try a 30-day social media fast. You'll likely discover you don't need these tools as much as you thought.
- Structure your leisure time instead of defaulting to passive internet entertainment.
