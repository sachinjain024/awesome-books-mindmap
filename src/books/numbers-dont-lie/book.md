sections:
  - title: PEOPLE & NATIONS
    chapters:
      - number: 1
        title: People
        subtitle: Population, Life Expectancy & Urbanization
        description: How global population growth is slowing, why life expectancy doubled in a century, and how the world went from 3% urban in 1800 to over 55% urban today. The numbers behind humanity's greatest transformation.

      - number: 2
        title: Countries
        subtitle: Economic Development & Global Inequality
        description: The staggering GDP gaps between nations, Asia's extraordinary economic rise, and what the data tells us about why some countries prosper while others remain poor. South Korea's transformation from poverty to wealth in a single generation.

      - number: 3
        title: Machines, Designs & Devices
        subtitle: Technological Progress in Numbers
        description: A century of engineering improvement by the numbers — car engine efficiency, jet aviation advances, the computing revolution, and how LED lighting quietly became one of the most impactful innovations in history.

      - number: 4
        title: Fuels & Electricity
        subtitle: The Energy Transition by the Numbers
        description: Fossil fuels still supply over 80% of the world's energy. Renewables are growing fast but face the hard math of energy transitions. Why decarbonizing the global economy is the most complex challenge humanity has ever faced.

        title: Transport
        subtitle: How We Move, By the Numbers
        description: Comparing the true energy cost of bicycles, trains, cars, and planes. How aviation doubled its passenger count in 20 years. Why shipping containers are one of the most underappreciated innovations in economic history.

      - number: 6
        title: Food
        subtitle: Feeding the World, By the Numbers
        description: The Green Revolution that prevented mass starvation, the water and carbon footprint of different foods, and why one-third of all food produced globally is wasted. The challenge of feeding 10 billion people by 2050.

  - title: THE FUTURE
    chapters:
      - number: 7
        title: Environment & the Future
        subtitle: Climate, CO2, and What the Data Says
        description: The CO2 story in numbers, the hard-to-decarbonize sectors that nobody talks about, and Smil's characteristically honest assessment of what net zero actually requires — and how far away we are from achieving it.

keyTeachings:
  - principle: "Question the Headlines:"
    description: Most news stories misrepresent statistics. Smil shows how understanding rates, ratios, and context transforms how we interpret information. Always ask — per capita, compared to what, over what time period?

  - principle: "Energy Transitions Are Slow:"
    description: History shows energy transitions — from wood to coal, coal to oil — take 50 to 70 years. Decarbonizing in decades is unprecedented in human history and requires acknowledging the enormous scale of the challenge.

  - principle: "The Power of Per Capita:"
    description: Absolute numbers mislead. China's total CO2 emissions are the world's largest, but per capita they remain below the US. Always convert total figures to per-person rates to understand what numbers actually mean.

  - principle: "Efficiency Gains Are Real But Limited:"
    description: Technology dramatically improves efficiency, but absolute consumption keeps rising — the Jevons Paradox. Efficiency alone cannot solve environmental problems if total demand continues growing.

  - principle: "Food Waste Is Enormous:"
    description: Roughly one-third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted. Solving food waste alone could feed hundreds of millions of people without increasing farmland, water use, or greenhouse gas emissions.

  - principle: "Long-Term Thinking Is Essential:"
    description: Smil consistently shows that short-term trends mislead. The most important changes in energy, population, and economy unfold over decades and centuries — not news cycles and quarterly reports.

## About This Book

Vaclav Smil is one of the most respected scientists writing about energy, the environment, food production, and economic growth. Bill Gates calls him his favorite author. *Numbers Don't Lie* distills 71 essential facts about the modern world into bite-sized, data-driven chapters that challenge conventional wisdom and correct popular misconceptions. Where headlines sensationalize and politicians oversimplify, Smil grounds every argument in hard numbers and historical context.

The book covers an extraordinary range of topics — from the decline of infant mortality to the inefficiency of beef production, from the history of energy transitions to the computational power of smartphones. Each entry is short (2-4 pages), precise, and often surprising. Smil has no patience for fuzzy thinking or feel-good narratives. His method is always the same: find the data, calculate the rates, compare the magnitudes, and let the numbers tell the story.

This mind map organizes Smil's 71 entries into seven thematic sections, preserving the quantitative rigor of the original while providing enough context to make each insight memorable and applicable. Whether you want to understand energy, food, population, or technology — or simply want to think more clearly about a complex world — *Numbers Don't Lie* is an essential guide.
