## The CO2 Story in Numbers

The concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has risen from approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) in pre-industrial times to approximately 420 ppm today. This represents a 50% increase in 150 years — a change that would have taken tens of thousands of years under natural conditions.

Global average surface temperature has risen by approximately 1.2°C since pre-industrial times. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that without significant emissions reductions, temperatures could rise 2.5°C-4°C by 2100.

### The Annual Emissions Picture {.data-box}

Global CO2 emissions from energy and industry: approximately **37 billion tons per year** (as of recent data)

Top emitters by country (approximate share of global total):
- **China:** 27-30%
- **United States:** 14-15%
- **European Union:** 7-8%
- **India:** 7%
- **Russia:** 5%

Per capita emissions (tons of CO2 per person per year):
- **Australia:** ~15 tons
- **United States:** ~14 tons
- **Russia:** ~11 tons
- **Germany:** ~8 tons
- **China:** ~8 tons
- **World average:** ~4.7 tons
- **India:** ~1.9 tons
- **Sub-Saharan Africa:** ~0.8 tons

These per capita numbers are crucial. China's total emissions are larger than the US, but its per-capita emissions are barely above the global average. The historical responsibility for accumulated CO2 in the atmosphere is concentrated in wealthy countries that industrialized first.

## Hard-to-Decarbonize Sectors

The public discourse about decarbonization focuses disproportionately on electricity generation and personal cars — sectors where solutions are well-advanced. Smil insists on examining the sectors where decarbonization is genuinely difficult.

### The Four Material Pillars of Modern Civilization {.principle-box}

Smil identifies four materials that modern civilization cannot function without — and that are extremely difficult to produce without fossil fuels:

1. **Steel** — requires iron ore reduction using either coking coal or (in the future) hydrogen. Steel production emits approximately 1.8 billion tons of CO2 annually — about 5% of global emissions. Green steel using hydrogen is technically possible but currently 2-3 times more expensive.

2. **Cement** — the production of calcium silicate clinker (the key ingredient) chemically releases CO2 regardless of the energy source used. Cement production contributes approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions. Carbon capture is possible but adds significant cost.

3. **Plastics** — currently made almost entirely from petrochemical feedstocks. Replacing fossil fuel feedstocks with bio-based alternatives at the required scale (400 million tons per year) remains enormously challenging.

4. **Ammonia (fertilizer)** — the Haber-Bosch process uses natural gas both as energy and as hydrogen feedstock. Replacing it with green hydrogen is technically feasible but currently far more expensive.

Decarbonizing these four sectors alone — which together account for roughly 17-20% of global CO2 — requires technologies that are available in demonstration but not at commercial scale.

## What Net Zero Really Requires

The term "net zero" — meaning that human activities add no net CO2 to the atmosphere — has become ubiquitous in corporate and government commitments. Smil insists on examining what it actually requires.

### The Honest Assessment {.insight-box}

To reach net zero by 2050:
- All existing coal power plants must be retired or fitted with carbon capture within 25 years
- All existing gasoline and diesel vehicles must be replaced with zero-emission alternatives within 25 years
- Steel, cement, and chemical production must be redesigned around zero-carbon processes
- Aviation, shipping, and industrial heat must find alternatives to fossil fuels
- Carbon dioxide removal (from the atmosphere) at the scale of billions of tons per year must be deployed — using technologies that don't yet exist at commercial scale

This is not an argument against trying. It is an argument for honesty about the scale of the transformation required, the technologies that must be developed, and the time it will take.

Smil's consistent message is not pessimism — it is the demand for what he calls "rational optimism": set ambitious goals, but build them on a realistic understanding of the systems, materials, and timescales involved.

### Reflection {.reflection}

What would you need to believe about energy technology, political will, and global coordination to be confident that net zero by 2050 is achievable? Which of those beliefs is best supported by historical evidence?

## Key Takeaways

- Atmospheric CO2 has risen from 280 ppm pre-industrial to 420 ppm today — a 50% increase in 150 years
- Per-capita emissions reveal that wealthy countries have vastly higher footprints than developing nations — Australia and the US at ~14-15 tons vs. India at ~1.9 tons
- Hard-to-decarbonize sectors — steel, cement, plastics, ammonia — account for 17-20% of global CO2 and require technologies not yet at commercial scale
- Net zero by 2050 requires retiring all coal plants, replacing all fossil fuel vehicles, and decarbonizing industrial processes within 25 years — an unprecedented pace of change
- Carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere will be necessary at billion-ton scale using technologies that don't yet exist commercially
- Smil's consistent message: honest about the challenge, insistent on accurate numbers, cautious about timelines — but not pessimistic about human ingenuity
