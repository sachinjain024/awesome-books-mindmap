## About This Book

Kim Scott learned a crucial leadership lesson at Google: the best bosses both care personally AND challenge directly. This combination—Radical Candor—creates cultures where people thrive.

Most managers fall into one of three traps: Ruinous Empathy (caring without challenging), Obnoxious Aggression (challenging without caring), or Manipulative Insincerity (neither caring nor challenging). Each fails in different ways, but all harm both people and results.

This mind map explores the framework and practical techniques for giving praise and criticism that actually helps people grow. You'll learn how to get feedback before giving it, how to praise effectively, how to criticize without crushing confidence, and how to build a team culture where candor is the norm.
