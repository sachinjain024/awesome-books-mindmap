Most people dramatically under-praise. They save praise for big achievements and ignore the daily work that deserves recognition. Effective praise is specific, sincere, and immediate—and it's not optional.

## Why Praise Matters

Praise isn't just "nice to have"—it's critical for learning and motivation. People need to know what they're doing well so they can do more of it.

### The Purpose of Praise {.care-box}

- Shows people what "good" looks like
- Reinforces behaviors you want to see more of
- Builds confidence and trust
- Makes criticism easier to hear later
- Prevents people from questioning their value

## Be Specific

Generic praise ("great job!") is forgettable and ineffective. Specific praise tells people exactly what they did well.

### Generic vs. Specific Praise {.comparison-box}

**Generic (Weak):**
- "Nice work on the presentation!"
- "You're a great employee"
- "Keep it up!"
- "Good job on the project"

**Specific (Strong):**
- "Your opening story grabbed everyone's attention—that's exactly how to start a pitch"
- "The way you debugged that issue by checking logs first saved us hours"
- "You asked clarifying questions that prevented a major misunderstanding"
- "The documentation you wrote made onboarding the new hire seamless"

## Be Sincere

People can detect fake praise instantly. If you don't mean it, don't say it. And never praise someone just to soften upcoming criticism.

### Avoid These Praise Mistakes {.warning-box}

- **The "praise sandwich":** Praise → Criticism → Praise (people see through this)
- **Personality praise:** "You're so smart" (focuses on identity, not actions)
- **Insincere praise:** Praising something mediocre just to be nice
- **Public praise for private people:** Know your audience
- **Comparison praise:** "You're better than [colleague]" (creates competition)

## Praise Immediately and In Person

Praise loses impact when delayed. Give it as soon as you notice something praise-worthy. And whenever possible, do it face-to-face.

### The HIP Principle (for Praise) {.principle-box}

Make praise:
- **Helpful:** Tells them what to keep doing
- **Immediate:** Given right away, not weeks later
- **In Person:** Or at least via video call, not just Slack

## Praise in Public (Usually)

Most people appreciate public recognition, but know your team. Some people find public praise embarrassing.

## Key Takeaways

- Most managers under-praise dramatically
- Be specific: tell people exactly what they did well
- Be sincere: fake praise is worse than no praise
- Give praise immediately and in person when possible
- Public praise works for most people, but know your audience
- Praise is not optional—it's critical for growth
