Getting stuff done collaboratively means avoiding two extremes: being a dictator (deciding everything alone) and being too hands-off (abdicating responsibility). This chapter introduces the "Get Stuff Done" wheel for driving results through collaboration.

## The Get Stuff Done Wheel

Great bosses don't just decide or delegate. They create a collaborative process that generates better ideas and stronger buy-in.

### The Seven Steps {.concept-box}

1. **Listen:** Create space for ideas to emerge
2. **Clarify:** Sharpen the idea through questions and debate
3. **Debate:** Explore perspectives and challenge assumptions
4. **Decide:** Make a clear decision (don't let it drag on)
5. **Persuade:** Explain the decision and bring skeptics along
6. **Execute:** Get it done with clear ownership
7. **Learn:** Reflect on results and feed back into listening

## 1. Listen: Create a Culture of Listening

Most bosses listen poorly. They interrupt, finish people's sentences, or mentally prepare their response instead of actually hearing.

### How to Really Listen {.principle-box}

- **Give quiet time:** Not everyone processes thoughts out loud. Give people time to think.
- **Create listening tours:** Regularly ask "What's on your mind?" with no agenda
- **Hold office hours:** Block time when anyone can drop by
- **Skip the meeting:** Walk around and have informal conversations
- **Listen with your whole body:** Put away devices, make eye contact, nod

## 2. Clarify: Sharpen the Idea

Raw ideas are messy. Help people clarify by asking questions, not by taking over and "fixing" their idea.

### Clarifying Questions {.challenge-box}

- "What problem are we solving?"
- "Who is this for?"
- "What would success look like?"
- "What's the simplest version of this?"
- "What are we assuming that might not be true?"

## 3. Debate: Explore Every Angle

Good debate is about finding truth, not winning arguments. Create a culture where people challenge ideas (not people) without fear.

## 4. Decide: Don't Let It Drag On

At some point, debate must end and someone must decide. As the leader, it's often you—but not always.

## 5. Persuade: Bring People Along

Once decided, explain the reasoning. Even those who disagreed need to understand why the decision was made.

## 6. Execute: Clear Ownership

Make sure someone owns the work. "We'll all do it" means no one does it.

## 7. Learn: Close the Loop

What worked? What didn't? Feed the learning back into listening.

## Key Takeaways

- The Get Stuff Done wheel: Listen, Clarify, Debate, Decide, Persuade, Execute, Learn
- Collaboration isn't abdication—you still make decisions
- Great leaders create environments where the best ideas win
- Each step is important; skipping steps creates problems
- Close the loop by learning and feeding back into listening
