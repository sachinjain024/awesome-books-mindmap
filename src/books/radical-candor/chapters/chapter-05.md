Not everyone wants to climb the corporate ladder. Some people want rapid career growth; others want to excel at what they do without taking on management. Both paths are valid, and great bosses understand what each person on their team wants.

## The Career Ladder Myth

Organizations assume everyone wants to move "up." But for many people, moving into management means doing less of what they love.

### The Problem with "Up or Out" {.warning-box}

- Loses great individual contributors by forcing them into management
- Creates bad managers (people who don't want to manage)
- Punishes people who want to stay excellent at their craft
- Assumes ambition only means climbing the ladder
- Ignores people's actual motivations and strengths

## Steep Growth Trajectory vs. Gradual Growth Trajectory

Kim Scott proposes two valid career trajectories: people on a steep growth trajectory (ambitious for new challenges and promotions) and people on a gradual growth trajectory (ambitious for excellence in their current role).

### Two Valid Paths {.comparison-box}

**Steep Growth Trajectory:**
- Wants rapid career progression
- Seeks new challenges constantly
- Willing to change roles, teams, or companies
- Energized by learning new things
- Thrives on increased responsibility

*Your role as boss:* Give stretch assignments, promotions, new challenges

**Gradual Growth Trajectory:**
- Wants to excel at current role
- Values stability and mastery
- Happy without constant change
- May have priorities outside work (family, hobbies)
- Not less ambitious—differently ambitious

*Your role as boss:* Honor their choice, give opportunities for mastery, protect from "up or out" pressure

## Trajectories Change

People move between trajectories throughout their careers. Someone might be on a steep trajectory, then shift to gradual after having kids—then shift back years later. The key is staying in conversation.

### Life Changes Career Trajectories {.concept-box}

Events that might shift someone's trajectory:
- Having children or caring for aging parents
- Health issues or burnout recovery
- Pursuing passion projects or education
- Life stage transitions
- Personal priorities shifting

## Key Takeaways

- Not everyone wants to climb the corporate ladder
- Steep growth trajectory: wants promotions and new challenges
- Gradual growth trajectory: wants mastery and stability
- Both paths are equally valid and valuable
- People's trajectories change throughout their careers
- Your job is to understand what each person wants and support it
