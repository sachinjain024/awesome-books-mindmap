Building a kick-ass team means hiring right, firing when necessary, promoting carefully, and making tough decisions about team composition. This chapter covers the hardest parts of management: people decisions.

## Hiring: Don't Lower the Bar

When you're desperate to fill a role, it's tempting to hire someone "good enough." But one bad hire can damage team culture and morale for years.

### The Cost of a Bad Hire {.warning-box}

- Drags down team performance
- Lowers the bar for future hires ("Well, we hired them...")
- Demoralizes top performers
- Forces you to spend time managing them out later
- Signals you don't care about quality

### Hiring Standards {.principle-box}

- **Skills:** Can they do the job?
- **Trajectory:** Are they learning and growing?
- **Culture fit:** Do they share your values? (Not "do I want to grab a beer with them")
- **Collaboration:** Will they make the team better?
- **The sniff test:** Are you genuinely excited to work with them?

If you're unsure, the answer is no.

## Firing: Don't Wait Too Long

Most managers wait too long to fire underperformers, hoping they'll improve. This harms the team, the person, and you.

### When to Fire Someone {.concept-box}

Consider firing if:
- They're not meeting expectations despite clear feedback and support
- They violate company values (respect, integrity, etc.)
- Their presence is damaging team morale or performance
- You've given them a fair chance to improve and they haven't
- You're spending all your time managing them instead of the team

### Before You Fire: The Three Questions {.challenge-box}

1. **Have I given Radically Candid feedback?** Have you been clear about the problem?
2. **Have I given them time and support to improve?** Did they have a real chance?
3. **Is this about performance or fit?** Maybe they're great but wrong for this role.

If you can answer yes to the first two and the issue persists, it's time to move on.

## Promotions: Don't Promote Too Fast

Promoting someone before they're ready sets them up to fail. Promoting the wrong person demoralizes the team.

## Key Takeaways

- Don't lower the hiring bar—one bad hire damages everything
- Fire underperformers after giving clear feedback and fair chances
- Retaining bad performers punishes good performers
- Promote carefully—too fast or too slow both cause problems
- The hardest decisions are people decisions, but they matter most
