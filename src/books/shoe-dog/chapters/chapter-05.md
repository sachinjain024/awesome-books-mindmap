## The Bank Calls the Loan

The crisis arrives without warning. The Bank of California, under new management and with new risk tolerances, calls Blue Ribbon's loan. They want their money back immediately. Blue Ribbon doesn't have it — the money is tied up in inventory sitting in a warehouse or already shipped to customers. Knight has days to find replacement financing or the company is finished.

What follows is one of the most harrowing sequences in *Shoe Dog* — a desperate scramble for capital across multiple lenders, frantic calls to Japan, and sleepless nights that Knight describes with characteristic candor. He is terrified. He doesn't show it, but he is.

The immediate crisis is solved through a combination of emergency borrowing from his father, advances from Japanese suppliers, and a fortuitous relationship with a new bank. But the message is unmistakable: Blue Ribbon is completely at the mercy of its lenders and its sole supplier. This cannot continue.

### The Simultaneous Threat From Onitsuka {.lesson-box}

While the banking crisis unfolds, the Onitsuka Tiger situation deteriorates into open conflict. Knight, having discovered through a sales visit to Japan that Onitsuka is actively courting other American distributors, confronts the issue directly. The relationship — always a fragile mix of gratitude and mutual dependency — breaks down.

Onitsuka files a lawsuit, alleging that Blue Ribbon has violated exclusivity terms. Blue Ribbon countersues, alleging that Onitsuka had been plotting to replace them. The legal battle will drag on for years, costing money Blue Ribbon doesn't have and consuming mental energy Knight desperately needs for building the business.

## Carolyn Davidson and the Swoosh

In the middle of this storm, Knight asks a Portland State University graphic design student named Carolyn Davidson to create a logo for the new brand they're planning. He tells her he needs something that suggests movement. She shows him several options. He doesn't love any of them but is running out of time.

### The $35 Logo {.insight-box}

Knight pays Davidson $35 for the Swoosh. It becomes one of the most valuable logos in human history.

Knight's reaction to the Swoosh is characteristically unglamorous: he doesn't love it. He tells Davidson he hopes it will grow on him. It does. But the story of the Swoosh is not really about design genius or perfect vision — it's about making decisions under pressure with imperfect information, and then committing to those decisions with everything you have.

## Choosing the Name "Nike"

The new brand needs a name. The team batters around options for weeks. Jeff Johnson, characteristically, comes up with the right answer: Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Someone else on the team wanted "Dimension Six." Knight himself wasn't sure about Nike either.

They go with Nike because they have to go with something, and the deadline for the shoe order is the next morning.

### What Brand Ownership Means {.principle-box}

The birth of Nike is not a triumphant moment in the book — it's a desperate scramble. But it represents a fundamental shift in the company's strategic position. Blue Ribbon Sports sold someone else's shoes. Nike would sell its own. This difference is everything.

When you own the brand, you own the relationship with the customer. You own the design decisions. You own the future. No supplier can call your loan, pull your contract, or replace you with a larger partner. The vulnerability that had nearly killed Blue Ribbon was permanently solved by the creation of Nike.

### Reflection {.reflection}

What would it mean to own your brand — in your career, your business, or your creative work? What is the cost of being a distributor of someone else's vision versus the creator of your own?

## Key Takeaways

- Cash crises in growing businesses are not failures — they are tests that reveal the true strength of your relationships and your resolve
- Legal battles consume resources and attention that entrepreneurial companies can rarely afford; avoid them when possible, but don't back down when the alternative is losing everything
- The Swoosh was created under deadline pressure for $35 — great decisions are often made with imperfect information in impossible time frames
- Brand ownership solves the most fundamental strategic vulnerability of any business built on someone else's product
- The name "Nike" was chosen because they needed a name by morning — good enough, on time, beats perfect, too late
- Crisis as catalyst: the Onitsuka relationship's collapse forced Blue Ribbon to become something far more valuable — a company with its own brand
