## Becoming a Real Company

By 1978, Nike is too large to operate as it always has. Revenue has crossed $140 million. The company employs hundreds of people. The casual, family-style management structure of the early years — decisions made around Knight's kitchen table, strategy formed on the fly — is no longer sufficient.

Knight hires professional managers, builds organizational structure, and — painfully — loses some of the original team members who cannot adapt to the new formality. This is one of the most emotionally difficult passages in the book: the recognition that the people who built something may not be the right people to run what it has become.

The transition from startup to corporation is never clean. At Nike, it involves genuine losses — of culture, of intimacy, of the particular energy that comes from a small group of true believers doing the impossible together.

### The Decision to Go Public {.principle-box}

By 1980, Knight decides Nike must go public. The reasons are straightforward: the company needs capital to fund continued growth, and the early investors — including the Japanese trading companies and Knight's closest colleagues — deserve liquidity for their faith and patience.

The IPO process is demanding and strange. Investment bankers scrutinize every aspect of the business. Legal teams examine every contract, every relationship, every decision from the past eighteen years. Nike must now be a certain kind of company — transparent, formal, answerable to public shareholders — that it has never been before.

## IPO Day

December 2, 1980. Nike goes public at $22 per share. By the end of the first day of trading, Phil Knight is worth roughly $178 million.

He feels numb.

This is the emotional truth at the heart of *Shoe Dog*: the destination is less satisfying than the journey. Knight has spent eighteen years fighting for survival, managing crises, building something he believed in completely. The IPO is the validation of all that effort — and it feels hollow. The struggle, it turns out, was the point.

### What the IPO Really Meant {.insight-box}

The IPO is not the climax of *Shoe Dog* — it's the denouement. The real story is everything that came before: the handshake in Kobe, the shoes sold from a car trunk, the bank that called the loan at midnight, the Swoosh that cost $35, the waffle iron in Bowerman's kitchen.

Knight reflects deeply in the final chapters on what it all meant. He doesn't pretend the money was meaningless — it provided security and options. But he is honest about what it could not provide: the feeling of being in the thick of it, of building something from nothing, of the particular camaraderie that comes from shared struggle.

## The Shoe Dog's Final Reflection

The book ends not with triumph but with meditation. Knight thinks about the friends who didn't make it — the team members who burned out, left, or were pushed out in the transition to a larger company. He thinks about Bowerman, aging and brilliant to the end. He thinks about what he might do differently.

His central advice to younger people is not about business strategy. It is more personal and more profound: seek work that feels like a calling, not just a career. Pursue the crazy idea. Fight for it. The struggle itself — not the outcome — is what makes a life worth living.

### Reflection {.reflection}

If you achieved everything you're currently working toward, would the achievement feel as meaningful as the struggle to get there? What does that tell you about where the real value lies?

## Key Takeaways

- The transition from startup to corporation requires structural change that can feel like a betrayal of the original culture — manage it with honesty and respect for what came before
- An IPO creates wealth but rarely creates meaning — meaning comes from the struggle, the building, the team, and the calling
- The people who build something may not be the people who can run it at scale; recognizing this truth compassionately is one of the hardest leadership tasks
- Financial success is a byproduct of pursuing a genuine calling, not a destination worth pursuing for its own sake
- The best business memoir is also a meditation on life: what you build, who you build it with, and what it all meant in the end
- Seek a calling — something you would do even if you knew how hard it would be, how often you would fail, how long it would take
