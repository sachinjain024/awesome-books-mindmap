keyTeachings:
  - principle: "The Crazy Idea:"
    description: Every great company starts with an idea others think is foolish. Knight's "crazy idea" of importing Japanese running shoes was dismissed by nearly everyone — including his father. Act on the idea anyway.

  - principle: "Embrace the Shoe Dog:"
    description: Knight describes true "shoe dogs" as people who love the shoe business so completely they become consumed by it. This obsession — not strategy or capital — is what drives the excellence that builds enduring companies.

  - principle: "Cash Flow Is Life:"
    description: Nike nearly died multiple times from cash flow problems, not lack of demand. Revenue growth without capital is a trap. Understanding that cash flow trumps profit is a hard-earned business truth that almost ended Nike before it began.

  - principle: "Build a Team of Misfits:"
    description: Knight deliberately hired unconventional people — Jeff Johnson the obsessive collector, Rob Strasser the brawling attorney, Geoff Hollister the runner. Their passion and quirks made them extraordinary. Hire for fire, not just fit.

  - principle: "The Relationship with Japan:"
    description: Nike's early survival depended entirely on its relationships with Japanese manufacturers. Knight's story shows how international partnerships — built on trust and mutual respect — can define a company's entire future.

  - principle: "The Long Run:"
    description: Knight's philosophy is that truly great things take time and sustained effort. Nike's story from 1962 to 1980 is one of perseverance through constant obstacles, doubt, near-bankruptcy, and setback — and choosing to keep going every single time.

## About This Book

*Shoe Dog* is Phil Knight's raw, unfiltered memoir about building Nike from nothing. It begins in 1962 with a 24-year-old Stanford MBA student who has a single, seemingly absurd idea: import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan and sell them to American athletes. It ends in 1980 with one of the greatest IPOs in business history. In between is one of the most honest accounts of entrepreneurship ever written.

What makes *Shoe Dog* different from most business memoirs is Knight's willingness to show the fear, the doubt, and the near-disasters. Nike was weeks from bankruptcy multiple times. Banks dropped them without warning. Their primary supplier tried to destroy them with a lawsuit. The IRS investigated them for fraud. Partners betrayed them. Through it all, Knight and his ragtag team of "shoe dogs" — obsessive, passionate people who lived and breathed shoes — kept running.

This mind map traces the journey decade by decade, from the handshake deal in Kobe that started everything to the iconic Swoosh that changed sports culture forever. Each chapter captures a critical era in Nike's founding story, distilling the key events, lessons, and the particular brand of stubborn, creative persistence that turned a crazy idea into a global legend.
