## About This Book

Peter Drucker, the father of modern management, wrote this classic in 1967—and it remains remarkably relevant today. The book's central insight: effectiveness can be learned. Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results.

The book introduces five practices that transform capable people into effective executives. These aren't personality traits or natural talents—they're disciplines that anyone can learn and practice. From managing time deliberately to focusing on contribution, from building on strengths to making decisions based on principle, Drucker provides timeless wisdom for getting the right things done.

This mind map distills Drucker's five practices that transform capable people into effective executives.
