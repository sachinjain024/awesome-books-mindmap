## About This Book

**Total: 30 Chapters across 5 Parts**

In *India after Gandhi*, Ramachandra Guha presents a magisterial history of independent India from 1947 to the early 2000s. This is the story of how a poor, divided, and religiously diverse nation defied all predictions of collapse to become the world's largest democracy.

The central question: **How has India survived and evolved as a democratic, pluralistic nation against all odds?**

## Core Themes of India after Gandhi

The book explores several interconnected themes throughout India's post-independence journey:

- **Democratic Resilience:** How India maintained democracy despite poverty, illiteracy, and diversity
- **Unity in Diversity:** The ongoing negotiation between national unity and regional/linguistic identities
- **Secularism Under Stress:** The constant tension between secular ideals and religious nationalism
- **Center vs. States:** The evolving balance of power between New Delhi and state governments
- **Development Challenges:** The struggle to lift millions out of poverty while building a modern economy
- **Kashmir's Shadow:** The unresolved conflict that has shaped India's relationship with Pakistan
