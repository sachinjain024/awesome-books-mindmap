The partition created the largest refugee crisis in human history. This chapter examines how independent India dealt with the overwhelming challenge of rehabilitating millions of displaced persons—a crisis that threatened to overwhelm the newborn state.

## The Scale of Displacement

An estimated 15 million people crossed the new borders. Roughly 7.5 million Hindus and Sikhs came to India from Pakistan, while a similar number of Muslims left India for Pakistan. Most arrived with nothing—their property lost, their families scattered, their lives destroyed.

**Key Statistics:**
- **7.5M** Refugees to India
- **5M** From Punjab alone
- **500K** In Delhi camps

## Two Different Migrations

The refugee flows from West Pakistan (Punjab) and East Pakistan (Bengal) were different in character and timing.

### The Punjab Migration {.historical-event}

This was sudden and violent. Within months of partition, virtually the entire Hindu and Sikh population of West Punjab had fled or been killed. They came as massive caravans—sometimes hundreds of thousands strong—walking for days to reach safety. The migration was complete by early 1948.

### The Bengal Migration {.historical-event}

This was more gradual and continued for decades. Initial violence was less severe (partly due to Gandhi's presence), so many Hindus stayed in East Pakistan. But periodic riots pushed successive waves to West Bengal. The last major influx came in 1971 during the Bangladesh war.

## The Rehabilitation Effort

The government established the Ministry of Rehabilitation to handle the crisis. Refugee camps were set up across North India. Properties left by departing Muslims were allocated to incoming refugees, though the process was chaotic and often unfair.

### The Rehabilitation Ministry {.key-figure}

The ministry distributed land, provided loans, allocated houses, and helped refugees find employment. In Punjab, refugees received land from the Evacuee Property Pool—lands left by Muslims who had gone to Pakistan. The system was rough justice, but it worked.

Delhi was transformed. Before partition, it had a significant Muslim population. After, it became a largely Hindu city, with refugees settling in areas like Lajpat Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, and Punjabi Bagh—names that still reflect their refugee origins.

## Refugee Politics

Refugees were not merely victims—they were political actors. They demanded compensation, housing, and recognition. Their votes mattered. Politicians who ignored them did so at their peril.

### The Refugee Vote {.political-analysis}

In Punjab and Delhi, refugees became a powerful political constituency. Their hard work and entrepreneurial energy transformed the economy. But their trauma also shaped politics—many harbored deep resentment toward Muslims and Pakistan, fueling Hindu nationalism.

## The Bengal Difference

While Punjab refugees were largely rehabilitated, Bengal refugees remained in limbo for decades. West Bengal was already densely populated and economically weaker than Punjab. The state government struggled to provide land and housing.

Many Bengali refugees ended up in permanent camps that became de facto slums. The Communist Party built its base partly on organizing these dispossessed refugees—their grievances fueling Left politics in Bengal for generations.

### The Marichjhapi Massacre {.crisis-box}

In 1979, Bengali Hindu refugees who had been settled in the Andaman Islands tried to return to West Bengal. The Left Front government used force to evict them from Marichjhapi in the Sundarbans. Hundreds, possibly thousands, died—a tragedy that remained hidden for years.

## Economic Impact

The refugees, despite their trauma, contributed enormously to India's economy. Punjab refugees brought entrepreneurial energy that transformed Delhi from a sleepy administrative capital into a commercial hub. They started businesses, built industries, and drove economic growth.

### Refugee Enterprise {.milestone-box}

Many of India's leading business families trace their origins to partition refugees. Deprived of everything, they had nothing to lose. Their drive to rebuild transformed cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. The "refugee mentality" of hard work and risk-taking became a stereotype with considerable truth.
