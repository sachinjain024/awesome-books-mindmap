Nehru's death in May 1964 opened a succession struggle. Who would lead India after the towering figure who had shaped the nation for seventeen years? This chapter examines the brief Shastri era and the rise of Indira Gandhi amid bitter party rivalries.

## The Succession Question

Nehru had refused to name a successor, believing it undemocratic. His death left a vacuum. The Congress was dominated by regional bosses—the "Syndicate"—who would play kingmaker.

### The Syndicate {.key-figure}

The Syndicate consisted of powerful state leaders: K. Kamaraj (Tamil Nadu), S.K. Patil (Maharashtra), Atulya Ghosh (West Bengal), and others. They controlled the party machinery and determined who would become Prime Minister.

## Lal Bahadur Shastri

The Syndicate chose Lal Bahadur Shastri—a humble, soft-spoken man from Uttar Pradesh. He was seen as a compromise candidate, acceptable to all factions but beholden to the party bosses.

Shastri faced immediate challenges: food shortages, linguistic agitation, and tensions with Pakistan. His tenure would be brief but consequential.

## The Food Crisis

India faced severe food shortages in 1965-66 due to drought. The country became dependent on American food aid (PL-480). The humiliating "ship to mouth" existence—depending on grain ships from America—exposed the failures of agricultural policy.

### Dependence on America {.crisis-box}

President Johnson used food aid as leverage, insisting India reduce criticism of Vietnam. The dependence was deeply humiliating. It spurred later investment in the Green Revolution to achieve food self-sufficiency.

## The Anti-Hindi Agitation

January 1965 brought violent agitation in Tamil Nadu against Hindi becoming the sole official language. The Constitution's 15-year transition period was ending. South Indians feared Hindi imperialism.

### Tamil Nadu Burns {.historical-event}

Students immolated themselves in protest. Riots engulfed Tamil Nadu. The DMK rode the anti-Hindi wave. Shastri assured South Indians that English would continue—a compromise that defused the crisis but deepened regional resentments.

## The 1965 War with Pakistan

Pakistan, seeing India weakened after 1962, sent infiltrators into Kashmir in August 1965, hoping to trigger an uprising. When that failed, regular forces attacked. India responded by crossing the international border toward Lahore.

**Timeline:**
- **August 1965** — Operation Gibraltar: Pakistan sends infiltrators into Kashmir; uprising fails to materialize.
- **September 1** — Pakistan Attacks: Pakistan launches Operation Grand Slam toward Jammu.
- **September 6** — India Crosses Border: Indian forces attack toward Lahore, opening a new front.
- **September 23** — Ceasefire: UN-mediated ceasefire ends the war.

## Tashkent and Shastri's Death

Soviet mediation brought Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan to Tashkent in January 1966. An agreement was reached restoring the status quo ante. Hours after signing, Shastri died of a heart attack.

### Sudden Death {.crisis-box}

Shastri's death at Tashkent shocked India. Conspiracy theories flourished—was he murdered? There is no evidence, but the sudden death of a Prime Minister in a foreign country fueled suspicions. India was again without a leader.

## Enter Indira Gandhi

The Syndicate chose Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, as Prime Minister. They thought she would be pliable—a "goongi gudiya" (dumb doll) who would follow their direction. They were spectacularly wrong.

### The Surprise Choice {.key-figure}

Indira had the Nehru name but little political experience. The Syndicate expected to control her. They underestimated her ambition, her political instincts, and her ruthlessness. Within four years, she would destroy them.

## Key Takeaways

- The Syndicate of regional bosses controlled Congress after Nehru
- Shastri was a compromise choice but proved capable under pressure
- Food shortages and dependence on US aid humiliated India
- Anti-Hindi agitation in Tamil Nadu threatened national unity
- The 1965 war with Pakistan ended in stalemate at Tashkent
- Indira Gandhi's selection was meant to preserve Syndicate control
