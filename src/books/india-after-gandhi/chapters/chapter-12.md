India's borders were contested from the start. This chapter examines the challenges on multiple frontiers—the integration of tribal areas in the Northeast, tensions with China over Tibet and border demarcation, and the continuing conflict with Pakistan over Kashmir.

## The Northeast Frontier

India's northeast—a region of hills, forests, and diverse tribal populations connected to the mainland by a narrow corridor—presented unique challenges. The tribes had been largely autonomous under British rule; their integration into India was neither automatic nor easy.

### The Seven Sisters {.geographic-context}

The northeast included Assam and the tribal areas that would become separate states: Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura, and Arunachal Pradesh. These areas had distinct cultures, languages, and religions, often more connected to Southeast Asia than to the Indian heartland.

## The Naga Insurgency

The Naga tribes were the first to challenge Indian authority. The Naga National Council, led by Angami Zapu Phizo, demanded independence. They argued that Nagas were racially, culturally, and historically distinct from Indians.

### Armed Conflict {.crisis-box}

In 1956, the Nagas launched an armed insurgency. India responded with military force, leading to a brutal conflict that killed thousands. Villages were burned, civilians died, and allegations of human rights abuses mounted on both sides. The conflict continues in attenuated form today.

Nagaland was created as a separate state in 1963—an attempt to accommodate Naga aspirations within the Indian union. But the most militant groups continued to demand full independence.

## The China Border

India and China shared a long, poorly defined border. The British had drawn lines on maps, but these were never formally accepted by China. Two areas were particularly contested: Aksai Chin in the west and the Northeast Frontier Agency (now Arunachal Pradesh) in the east.

### The McMahon Line {.historical-event}

The McMahon Line, drawn by the British in 1914, defined the eastern border. India considered it the legal boundary; China rejected it as an imperialist imposition. In the west, the border was even less clear—different British-era maps showed different lines.

## Tibet and the Dalai Lama

China's annexation of Tibet in 1950 brought Chinese power directly to India's border. India, preoccupied with other crises, offered only verbal protests. But the issue festered.

**Timeline:**
- **1950** — Chinese Invasion of Tibet: China's People's Liberation Army enters Tibet; India protests weakly.
- **1954** — Panchsheel Agreement: India recognizes Chinese sovereignty over Tibet; Panchsheel principles signed.
- **1959** — Tibetan Uprising: Tibetans revolt; Dalai Lama flees to India; tensions escalate.

When the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed Tibetan uprising, China was furious. India's grant of asylum to the Dalai Lama poisoned Sino-Indian relations permanently.

## Border Incidents

Through the late 1950s, border incidents multiplied. China built a road through Aksai Chin, connecting Tibet to Xinjiang—India did not even discover this for years. Indian patrols encountered Chinese troops in areas India considered its territory.

### Nehru's Dilemma {.political-analysis}

Nehru was caught between domestic pressure to be tough with China and his own commitment to peaceful relations. He adopted a "Forward Policy" of establishing outposts near Chinese positions. China saw this as provocation. The stage was set for war.

## The Kashmir Stalemate

Meanwhile, the Kashmir dispute remained frozen. The ceasefire line from 1949 became a de facto border. Pakistan periodically raised the issue at the UN. India insisted the accession was final.

Kashmir was integrated more closely into India—Article 370 notwithstanding. Elections were held, though their fairness was questionable. Sheikh Abdullah, originally pro-India, was imprisoned in 1953 after expressing doubts about Kashmir's relationship with India.

### Sheikh Abdullah's Imprisonment {.crisis-box}

Abdullah was arrested without trial and held for years. His imprisonment alienated many Kashmiris who had supported accession to India. The seeds of future discontent were sown by treating Kashmir's popular leader as a prisoner.
