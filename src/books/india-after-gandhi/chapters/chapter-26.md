> "We are not begging for our rights. We are demanding what is ours."
> — Dalit Panthers manifesto

India's democratic framework provided space for social movements to expand rights and challenge oppression. This chapter examines the Dalit movement, women's rights struggles, environmental activism, and the expansion of civil liberties through court interventions.

## The Dalit Assertion

The post-Ambedkar generation of Dalits moved from seeking constitutional protection to demanding social transformation. The Dalit Panthers in Maharashtra (1972) signaled a new militancy modeled on America's Black Panthers.

### The Dalit Panthers {.key-figure}

Young Dalit writers and activists rejected passive acceptance of discrimination. They demanded dignity, confronted caste Hindus, and created a powerful literary movement. Dalit literature—poetry, autobiography, fiction—gave voice to experiences long silenced.

## The Mandal Commission

The Mandal Commission (1980) recommended reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government jobs and education. When implemented in 1990, it triggered massive upper-caste protests—and transformed Indian politics.

### Mandal Implementation {.historical-event}

V.P. Singh's announcement of Mandal implementation in 1990 led to upper-caste students immolating themselves in protest. The anti-Mandal movement was intense but ultimately unsuccessful. Reservations expanded—and caste became even more central to political mobilization.

## The Women's Movement

The 1970s and 1980s saw a resurgence of feminist activism. Campaigns against dowry deaths, domestic violence, and rape gained national attention. New laws were enacted, though enforcement remained weak.

### Key Women's Rights Developments {.milestone-box}

- **Dowry Prohibition Act (1961):** Strengthened in 1986
- **Mathura rape case (1979):** Sparked anti-rape movement
- **Shah Bano case (1985):** Muslim women's maintenance rights controversy
- **Domestic Violence Act (2005):** Comprehensive protection

## The Shah Bano Controversy

In 1985, the Supreme Court ruled that a divorced Muslim woman, Shah Bano, was entitled to maintenance from her ex-husband under the Criminal Procedure Code. Muslim conservatives protested; Rajiv Gandhi's government passed a law overturning the judgment.

### A Defining Controversy {.crisis-box}

The Shah Bano case crystallized tensions between women's rights and religious personal law. Critics accused Rajiv Gandhi of appeasing Muslim conservatives at women's expense. Supporters of the law argued for community autonomy. The debate continues today.

## Environmental Activism

The Chipko movement (tree-hugging) in the Himalayas and Narmada Bachao Andolan (Save Narmada Movement) challenged the development model that privileged large projects over affected communities.

### The Narmada Movement {.historical-event}

Medha Patkar led opposition to the Sardar Sarovar Dam, arguing it would displace hundreds of thousands without adequate rehabilitation. The movement questioned whether "development" that destroyed communities could be called progress.

## Public Interest Litigation

The Supreme Court expanded access to justice through Public Interest Litigation (PIL). Citizens could petition the court on behalf of others who lacked resources to litigate. The court took on issues from environmental protection to prison conditions.

### Judicial Activism {.milestone-box}

Justices like P.N. Bhagwati and V.R. Krishna Iyer expanded the scope of fundamental rights. Article 21 (right to life) was interpreted to include rights to health, education, and a clean environment. The courts became a forum for social reform.

## The Limits of Rights

Despite legal advances, enforcement remained weak. Dalits continued to face discrimination and violence. Women were killed for dowry. Environmental laws were flouted. The gap between law and practice remained India's greatest challenge.
