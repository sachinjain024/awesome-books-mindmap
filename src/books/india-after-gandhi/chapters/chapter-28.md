The 1990s transformed India politically and economically. This chapter examines the rise of coalition politics, economic liberalization, and the emergence of a genuinely competitive multi-party democracy after decades of Congress dominance.

## The End of Congress Dominance

The 1989 election ended Congress's era of single-party dominance. No party since has won an outright majority on its own. Coalition government became the norm, requiring negotiation, compromise, and power-sharing.

- **0** Single-party Majorities (1989-2014)
- **6** Prime Ministers (1989-2004)
- **15+** Parties in Coalitions

## Economic Liberalization

In 1991, facing a balance of payments crisis, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh initiated sweeping reforms. The License Raj was dismantled. Markets were opened. The Indian economy began its transformation.

### The 1991 Reforms {.milestone-box}

- Industrial licensing abolished for most sectors
- Import restrictions removed
- Rupee devalued and made convertible
- Foreign investment welcomed
- Public sector monopolies ended

> "Let the world hear it loud and clear: India is now wide awake. We shall prevail. We shall overcome."
> — Manmohan Singh, Budget Speech, 1991

## Coalition Instability

The 1990s saw rapid political change. Governments rose and fell. Prime Ministers came and went. Yet democracy deepened even as governments changed frequently.

- **1989-90 — V.P. Singh:** National Front government; Mandal implementation.
- **1990-91 — Chandra Shekhar:** Minority government dependent on Congress.
- **1991-96 — Narasimha Rao:** Congress minority government; economic reforms.
- **1996-98 — United Front:** Two Prime Ministers (Deve Gowda, Gujral); dependent on Congress.
- **1998-2004 — Vajpayee:** BJP-led NDA government; first full non-Congress term.

## The BJP in Power

The BJP, rising steadily since the Ayodhya movement, finally came to power in 1998. Atal Bihari Vajpayee led a coalition (NDA) of over 20 parties. He moderated the BJP's Hindutva agenda to hold the coalition together.

### Atal Bihari Vajpayee {.key-figure}

Vajpayee, a moderate compared to RSS hardliners, was acceptable to coalition partners. His government conducted nuclear tests, faced the Kargil War, and pursued economic reforms. He offered "the hand of friendship" to Pakistan.

## Regional Parties Ascendant

The era of coalition forced national parties to accommodate regional demands. Tamil Nadu's parties, Andhra's TDP, Bihar's RJD, and UP's SP and BSP became essential partners. Regional leaders extracted maximum benefits.

### Federal Balance Shifts {.political-analysis}

Coalition politics strengthened federalism. States gained more resources and policy autonomy. Chief Ministers became more powerful. The old Congress model of centralized control was no longer viable.

## The Rise of Caste Parties

Mandal's implementation politicized caste as never before. The BSP mobilized Dalits in UP. The SP and RJD championed OBCs. Caste became the primary basis of political mobilization in much of North India.

### Mayawati's BSP {.historical-event}

Mayawati became India's first Dalit Chief Minister in 1995. The BSP's rise showed that democracy could empower even the most marginalized. Caste politics, for all its problems, gave voice to those long excluded.

## A Mature Democracy

By the 2000s, India had achieved something remarkable: regular, free elections; peaceful transfers of power; expanding political participation; and genuine multi-party competition. Democracy had become habit.

> — Ramachandra Guha
