The 1962 Sino-Indian War was a devastating blow to India's self-image and to Nehru personally. In a brief, humiliating conflict, China inflicted a crushing defeat on the Indian army. This chapter examines the war, its causes, and its profound consequences for Indian politics and foreign policy.

## The Road to War

By 1962, Sino-Indian relations had deteriorated sharply. The Forward Policy—establishing Indian posts in disputed territory—provoked China. Neither side was willing to compromise on border claims they considered vital.

### The Fatal Miscalculation {.political-analysis}

Nehru and his advisors believed China would not attack. They assumed the international situation—China isolated after the Great Leap Forward famine—made war impossible. They were catastrophically wrong.

## The Chinese Attack

On October 20, 1962, China launched a massive attack on two fronts: in the northeast (NEFA) and in Ladakh. The Indian forces, poorly equipped, badly led, and spread thin, were overwhelmed.

### Military Disaster {.crisis-box}

Indian troops, equipped for counter-insurgency rather than conventional war, faced Chinese forces seasoned by the Korean War. Many Indian soldiers had no winter clothing. Some units had only 20 rounds of ammunition per man. The collapse was swift and total.

**Timeline:**
- **October 20** — Chinese Attack: Massive Chinese offensive on both fronts; Indian posts overrun.
- **October 24** — Chinese Ceasefire: China declares unilateral ceasefire; India rejects terms.
- **November 14-19** — Second Offensive: China resumes attack; Indian defenses collapse in NEFA.
- **November 21** — China Withdraws: China declares unilateral ceasefire and withdraws to pre-war positions in NEFA.

## The Humiliation

The defeat was total. India lost over 3,000 soldiers killed or captured. The myth of "Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai" was shattered. Nehru was forced to appeal for American military assistance—a blow to non-alignment.

In the northeast, Chinese forces advanced virtually unopposed. Tezpur was evacuated; there was panic in Assam. The Chinese could have taken Assam—but they stopped and withdrew.

## Why Did China Withdraw?

China's objectives remain debated. Having demonstrated military superiority and secured Aksai Chin, China withdrew from NEFA, returning to positions behind the McMahon Line. Possible reasons:

### Chinese Calculations {.political-analysis}

- Logistics: Maintaining forces in NEFA through winter would be difficult
- International pressure: The US and USSR supported India
- Limited objectives: China wanted to teach India a "lesson," not conquer territory
- Diplomatic position: Withdrawal strengthened China's claim to reasonableness

## The Impact on Nehru

The defeat aged Nehru visibly. He never recovered his confidence. In Parliament, he faced harsh criticism from his own party. A no-confidence motion—unthinkable before—received significant support.

### A Broken Man {.key-figure}

Nehru's health declined rapidly after the war. He suffered a stroke in January 1964 and died in May. Many believe the shock of the defeat hastened his death. The architect of independent India left the stage under the shadow of his greatest failure.

## The Consequences

The 1962 war transformed India. Defense spending increased dramatically. The army was modernized and expanded. Non-alignment was quietly modified to accept military assistance. Relations with China remained frozen for decades.

### Lasting Changes {.milestone-box}

- Defense budget doubled; military modernization accelerated
- Non-alignment modified; India accepted Western military aid
- China policy hardened; distrust became permanent
- Pakistan saw opportunity; 1965 war followed
- Public faith in government shaken; Nehru era ending

## The Lessons

The 1962 war revealed multiple failures: intelligence failure (not knowing China was preparing attack), military failure (poorly equipped and led forces), and political failure (miscalculating Chinese intentions). India learned painful lessons about the gap between rhetoric and reality.
