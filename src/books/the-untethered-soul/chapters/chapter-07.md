## Why We Close

Knowing that closing blocks energy is one thing; actually staying open is another. This chapter explores why we close and how we can transcend this automatic tendency through conscious awareness and willingness.

Closing is a protective mechanism. When something threatens us—physically, emotionally, or psychologically—closing is an attempt to shield ourselves from pain. The heart closes, energy contracts, and we pull back from the experience.

This made sense evolutionarily. If you were in physical danger, closing down would help you focus on survival. But the problem is that we now close to non-physical threats: criticism, rejection, uncertainty, change. We treat psychological discomfort the same way we'd treat a tiger attack.

## The Illusion of Protection

Here's Singer's radical insight: closing doesn't actually protect you. The event has already happened. Closing only determines how you experience its aftermath. When you close, you don't prevent the pain—you trap it inside and extend your suffering.

Staying open doesn't mean you'll never feel discomfort. It means discomfort will pass through you rather than getting stuck. Closing is like slamming the door after the wind is already inside—it just keeps the wind trapped.

### Key Insight {.insight-box}

The question isn't whether you'll experience difficult things—you will. The question is whether you'll close to them and suffer long-term, or stay open and let them pass through. Closing prolongs pain; openness allows release.

## Catching the Close

The first step in transcending closure is catching it when it happens. Most of the time, we close unconsciously. Something triggers us and—before we know it—we're contracted, defensive, and shut down.

With practice, you can begin to notice the moment of closing. There's often a physical sensation—a tightening in the chest, a holding of breath, a tensing of the body. If you can catch this moment, you can make a different choice.

### Practice: Catching the Close {.practice-box}

1. Notice any situation that disturbs your peace—however minor
2. Immediately bring attention to your heart center
3. Feel if there's any closing, tightening, or contraction
4. Don't judge yourself for closing—just notice
5. Ask yourself: "Can I stay open right now? Can I relax instead of tighten?"

## The Choice to Stay Open

Once you catch the closing, you have a choice: follow the automatic pattern and close, or consciously choose to stay open. Staying open doesn't mean suppressing the reaction—it means relaxing around it, giving it space, not letting it take over.

Singer emphasizes that this is not about positive thinking or pretending you're not affected. It's about feeling fully while not closing down. You can acknowledge that something is painful while choosing not to contract against it.

### The Hand in the Fist {.metaphor-box}

When something bothers you, it's like your hand clenching into a fist. You can become aware of the fist and consciously relax it back into an open hand. The trigger is still there, but you're not gripping around it anymore. This is what staying open feels like.

## Practice Through Small Things

You don't have to start with the biggest challenges. Start noticing your tendency to close with small annoyances: traffic, waiting in line, minor inconveniences. These are perfect practice opportunities because the stakes are low.

Each time you stay open through a small trigger, you strengthen your capacity for the bigger ones. It's like building a muscle. The more you practice, the more natural it becomes.

## The Willingness to Be Uncomfortable

At the core of staying open is a willingness to feel uncomfortable. We close because we don't want to feel certain things. Opening requires saying yes to whatever arises—including sensations and emotions we'd rather avoid.

This willingness is the key to freedom. When you're willing to feel anything, nothing can control you. You're no longer organizing your life around avoiding discomfort. You become truly free.

### Central Teaching {.central-teaching}

Freedom is not the absence of discomfort. Freedom is the willingness to feel anything without closing.
