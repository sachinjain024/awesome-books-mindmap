> "Eventually, you'll get so weighted down that you won't be able to move. You'll get too heavy to fly."
> — Michael A. Singer

## The Weight of Accumulated Blockages

Singer issues a passionate call to action: don't wait to let go. The longer you hold onto blocked energy, the heavier you become. Eventually, accumulated weight can pull you under. The time to release is now.

Every time you close and don't release, you add to the weight you carry. Each suppressed emotion, each unprocessed experience, each defended position becomes another burden on your soul. Over years and decades, this accumulates.

You can see this in people who are bitter, closed off, and heavy with resentment. They didn't become that way overnight. It happened one closing at a time, one unreleased hurt at a time, until the accumulated weight became overwhelming.

## The Urgency of Now

Singer's message is urgent: don't wait. Don't put off the work of releasing. Every moment you continue to close, you're adding more weight. Every day you delay dealing with stored pain, it becomes more entrenched.

There's a temptation to think you'll do this work later—when you have more time, when things calm down, when you feel ready. But "later" often never comes, and meanwhile the weight keeps accumulating.

### Key Insight {.insight-box}

You don't have unlimited time. Life is short, and the work of opening and releasing is urgent. The best time to let go is always now—this moment, this trigger, this closing.

## The Fall

What happens when you don't let go? Singer describes a gradual descent. At first, you just feel a little heavier. Then life becomes harder to enjoy. Eventually, you can become depressed, anxious, chronically angry, or simply numb.

The "fall" isn't necessarily dramatic—it's often a slow slide into a smaller, more defended, less alive existence. You don't notice it happening because it's gradual. But one day you look up and realize you've become someone you never wanted to be.

### The Drowning Person {.metaphor-box}

Imagine you're swimming with rocks in your pockets. Each rock is a piece of unresolved stuff you're carrying. One or two rocks, you can manage. But if you keep collecting rocks without releasing any, eventually you'll sink. The water hasn't changed—you've just become too heavy to stay afloat.

## The Choice Point

In every moment of closing, there's a choice point. You can go with the automatic pattern—close, defend, suppress—or you can choose to stay open and let the energy pass through. This choice, made repeatedly, determines the trajectory of your life.

Singer urges readers to take this choice seriously. It's not abstract philosophy—it's about whether you'll live a free, open, joyful life or sink under the weight of accumulated resistance.

## What Letting Go Looks Like

Letting go isn't complicated. It simply means not closing. When something triggers you, you feel the energy arise and you relax around it instead of clenching. You let the wave of emotion pass through without grabbing onto it or pushing it away.

It means not feeding the inner voice when it wants to ruminate and complain. It means not replaying the hurt over and over. It means feeling what you feel and then moving on, rather than building a permanent structure around the pain.

### Practice: Letting Go in the Moment {.practice-box}

1. Notice when something bothers you—the closing begins
2. Instead of engaging with the thoughts about it, drop attention to the body
3. Feel the energy of the disturbance—where is it? What does it feel like?
4. Breathe and relax around it; don't clench or resist
5. Keep relaxing until the energy naturally settles or releases
6. Return your attention to the present moment

## The Lightness of Release

When you do let go, there's an immediate sense of relief and lightness. The energy that was trapped is now flowing. The weight that was dragging you down is gone. This feeling is its own reward and motivation to keep letting go.

The more you release, the lighter you become. The lighter you become, the easier it is to stay open. It creates a positive momentum toward freedom.

- The "fall" is a gradual descent into heaviness, closure, and diminished life
- Every moment of closing is a choice point where you can choose differently
