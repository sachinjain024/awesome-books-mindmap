## The Constant Inner Narrator

Have you ever noticed that there is a voice inside your head that never stops talking? From the moment you wake up until the moment you fall asleep, this voice provides a running commentary on everything you experience. It comments on what you see, what others say, what you should do, what you should have done differently.

This voice talks about the past, worries about the future, and rarely lets you simply be present with what is happening right now. It has opinions about everything—the weather, your breakfast, your coworkers, the traffic, your life choices. It's like having a roommate who never stops talking.

## Recognizing the Voice

The first step toward freedom is simply becoming aware that this voice exists. Most people are so identified with their inner dialogue that they don't realize it's happening. They think they *are* the voice. But here's the key insight: if you can hear the voice, then who is doing the hearing?

### Key Insight {.insight-box}

The fact that you can observe your thoughts proves that you are not your thoughts. You are the awareness in which thoughts appear. This simple recognition is the beginning of all spiritual awakening.

Singer points out that this voice will talk about anything and everything. It will discuss trivial matters with the same intensity as life-changing decisions. It has no filter and no off switch—unless you begin to notice it and step back as the witness.

## The Voice's Contradictions

One of the most revealing things about the inner voice is that it often contradicts itself. One moment it says, "I should speak up more," and the next moment it says, "I shouldn't have said that." It builds you up and tears you down, sometimes within seconds.

The voice can be your worst critic and your most unrealistic cheerleader. It can spiral into anxiety one moment and drift into fantasy the next. If you truly listened to everything it said and took it all seriously, you would be paralyzed by contradictory instructions.

### The Radio Analogy {.metaphor-box}

Imagine the inner voice as a radio that's always on, constantly switching between stations. Sometimes it's playing anxiety, sometimes nostalgia, sometimes planning, sometimes criticism. You didn't choose these stations, and you can't turn the radio off—but you can recognize that you are not the radio. You are the one listening to it.

## Why Does the Voice Talk?

Singer suggests that the voice talks because you have a tendency to identify with it and give it your attention. It's trying to make sense of the world, to protect you, to figure everything out. But in its constant attempts to create safety and certainty, it often creates more anxiety and confusion.

The voice is not inherently bad—it's simply a mental process. The problem arises when we believe we *are* the voice, when we take every thought as truth, when we let the voice's fears and judgments run our lives.

### Practice: Noticing the Voice {.practice-box}

1. Throughout your day, pause and notice that there are thoughts happening
2. Without trying to change or stop the thoughts, simply observe them
3. Ask yourself: "Who is aware of these thoughts?"
4. Notice that you can watch the thoughts without being them
5. Return to this practice whenever you remember—the more often, the better

## Key Takeaways

- There is a constant voice talking inside your head, commenting on everything
- You are not the voice—you are the one who hears it
- The voice often contradicts itself and creates unnecessary suffering
- Simply becoming aware of the voice is the first step toward inner freedom
