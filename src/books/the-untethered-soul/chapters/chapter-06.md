> "In the heart, we find our deepest experience of life. When it's open, we feel love and enthusiasm. When it's closed, we feel fear and depression."
> — Michael A. Singer

## The Heart Center

Singer turns attention to the heart center—not the physical heart, but the energetic center in the middle of your chest where you feel emotions. This spiritual heart is the doorway through which energy flows and the place where openness and closing are most deeply felt.

Place your attention in the center of your chest. This is the area where you feel strong emotions—love, heartbreak, joy, grief. It's where you feel your heart "swell" with happiness or "sink" with disappointment. This is not mere metaphor; it's a real energetic experience.

Singer refers to this as the spiritual heart or the heart chakra. It's the seat of your emotional energy, the place where life's experiences are most intimately felt. Understanding this center is crucial for understanding how energy flows through you.

## How the Heart Opens and Closes

The heart opens and closes in response to your experiences. When something delightful happens—a beautiful sunset, a kind word, falling in love—the heart opens and you feel expansion, warmth, and energy. When something threatening or painful happens, the heart closes and you feel contraction, heaviness, and blocked energy.

Notice how physical this is. When your heart closes, you can actually feel it tighten. When it opens, you feel it relax and expand. These are not just mental states but tangible energetic experiences.

### Key Insight {.insight-box}

You feel experiences *through* your heart. The heart is the instrument through which life touches you. When it's open, life flows through you fully. When it's closed, you're cut off from the fullness of experience.

## Energy Patterns and Samskaras

Singer introduces the concept of "samskaras"—blocked patterns of energy stored in the heart from past experiences. When you don't fully process an experience—when you resist it, suppress it, or hold onto it—the energy of that experience gets stored in your heart.

These stored patterns then affect how you respond to present experiences. If you were hurt in a past relationship, that stored energy may cause you to close your heart whenever a similar situation arises, even if the present situation is different.

### Thorns in the Heart {.metaphor-box}

Imagine that unprocessed experiences are like thorns lodged in your heart. They stay there, sensitive to the touch. Whenever life "touches" that area—whenever something reminds you of the original wound—you feel pain and close down. The thorns explain why you react so strongly to certain triggers.

## The Heart Wants to Be Free

Despite all the blockages, the heart's natural tendency is toward openness. It wants to release the stored pain. It wants energy to flow freely. This is why old emotions sometimes surface unexpectedly—the heart is trying to let go, to heal itself.

The problem is that we usually resist this process. When old pain comes up, we push it back down. We distract ourselves, suppress our feelings, or create more mental noise. Instead of letting the heart release its burden, we re-block it.

## Allowing the Heart to Heal

Healing happens when you allow stored energy to pass through you. This means feeling the old emotions without resisting or clinging to them. It means being present with the discomfort long enough for it to release naturally.

This is counterintuitive because we usually try to avoid pain. But the stored energy can only be released by being felt. The way out is through.

### Practice: Heart Awareness {.practice-box}

1. Place your attention in the center of your chest
2. Notice whether the heart feels open or closed right now
3. If it feels closed, don't try to force it open—just notice
4. Breathe gently and allow whatever is there to be there
5. See if you can relax around any tightness, giving it space to soften

## Living with an Open Heart

Singer's ultimate teaching about the heart is that you can learn to keep it open all the time. This doesn't mean you won't feel pain—you'll actually feel everything more fully. But you won't close down in response. You'll let experiences pass through you rather than getting stored.

An open heart is vulnerable, yes, but it's also powerful. It can handle whatever life brings because it doesn't resist. It receives fully and releases fully, like a flowing stream rather than a stagnant pool.
