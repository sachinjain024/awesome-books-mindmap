## The Dichotomy of Control

This is perhaps the most fundamental Stoic principle: some things are within our control, and some things are not. Our task is to clearly distinguish between the two and focus our energy accordingly.

**Within your control:** Your thoughts, judgments, desires, aversions, and actions.

**Outside your control:** Other people's opinions, external events, outcomes, the past, and the future.

### The Epictetus Framework {.principle-box}

"Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions."

## The Time Illusion

We often say "I don't have enough time." But everyone has the same 24 hours. The difference is focus — how we direct our limited attention.

When we spend mental energy worrying about things outside our control, we're literally taking time and attention away from things we can actually influence. It's not a time problem; it's an allocation problem.

## Applying the Dichotomy

When facing any situation, ask yourself:

- **What can I control here?** Focus your energy entirely on this.
- **What can I influence?** Apply effort proportional to your influence.
- **What is completely outside my control?** Accept this and release attachment to outcomes.

This isn't passive resignation — it's strategic energy management. You fight where you can win and conserve resources elsewhere.

## Common Misallocations of Focus

- Worrying about what others think of you (uncontrollable)
- Ruminating on past mistakes (unchangeable)
- Anxiously predicting future disasters (unknowable)
- Trying to change someone who doesn't want to change
- Obsessing over competition instead of your own performance

### Daily Practice: The Control Audit {.practice-exercise}

- List what you worried about today
- Categorize each item: Control / Influence / No Control
- For items you can control: What action can you take?
- For items you can't: Practice saying "This is not mine to control"

### Reflection {.reflection}

How much of your mental energy this week went to things outside your control? What could you have accomplished if you'd redirected that energy to things within your power?

## Key Takeaways

- The dichotomy of control is the foundation of Stoic peace of mind
- You control your thoughts, judgments, and actions — not outcomes
- Time scarcity is often focus scarcity in disguise
- Energy spent on the uncontrollable is energy stolen from the controllable
- This isn't passive resignation — it's strategic focus
