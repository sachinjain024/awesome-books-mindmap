## Reframing Failure

We tend to view mistakes as evidence of inadequacy — proof that we're not good enough. But the Stoics saw failures differently: as teachers. Every stumble contains information. Every setback illuminates something you couldn't have learned any other way.

The mistake itself is in the past — unchangeable, fixed in history. But the lesson lives on and can be applied infinitely. **Which would you rather dwell on?**

### The Stoic View of Obstacles {.principle-box}

Marcus Aurelius's famous principle — "the obstacle is the way" — suggests that difficulties aren't interruptions to our path but actually constitute the path. The mistake isn't a detour from growth; it's a direct route to it.

## Why We Get Stuck on Mistakes

- **Ego protection:** We don't want to be wrong, so we avoid examining why we were
- **Shame spiral:** Self-blame consumes the energy needed for analysis
- **Fixed mindset:** We see the mistake as defining us rather than informing us
- **Rumination:** Replaying the error without extracting the lesson

## Extracting the Lesson

After any mistake or failure, work through these questions:

1. **What happened?** (Facts only, no judgment)
2. **What did I assume that turned out to be wrong?**
3. **What information did I miss or ignore?**
4. **What would I do differently if I could replay this?**
5. **What's the principle I can apply going forward?**

The goal is to transform a specific mistake into a general lesson that applies beyond this single instance.

## The Post-Mortem Without Blame

The Stoics practiced a form of self-examination that was rigorous but not harsh. Seneca would review his day each evening, asking what he had done wrong, but the tone was curious rather than condemning.

Approach your mistakes like a scientist studying data, not a judge passing sentence.

### Daily Practice: The Evening Review {.practice-exercise}

- At day's end, identify one thing that didn't go as planned
- Write down what happened without self-criticism
- Extract one concrete lesson or principle
- Identify one specific action you'll take tomorrow based on this learning

### Reflection {.reflection}

Think of a significant past failure. What lesson did it teach you? How has that lesson served you since? Would you have learned this any other way?

## Key Takeaways

- Mistakes are teachers, not verdicts on your worth
- The obstacle is the way — difficulties are the path to growth
- Separate what happened from what it means about you
- Extract principles that apply beyond the specific situation
- Review errors with curiosity, not condemnation
