## About This Book

*Unseen* by Megha Vishwanath examines Deepinder Goyal and Zomato through decisions, trade-offs, and turning points rather than a conventional linear biography. The narrative focuses on how a company is repeatedly built, stressed, and rebuilt across different phases of growth.

Based on published descriptions of the book, this mind map organizes the story into three arcs: origins and early product formation, survival-to-scale transitions, and the public-markets plus quick-commerce era.

## Who This Mind Map Is For

This mind map is useful for readers who want:
- Founder and startup decision patterns, not motivational storytelling
- A practical view of how strategy changes under pressure
- Lessons on operating through ambiguity, capital constraints, and public scrutiny
- A compact way to revisit major Zomato-era inflection points

## How This Mind Map Helps

This structure turns a complex, interview-rich business narrative into navigable components. You can jump to specific phases (early build, acquisition, IPO, quick commerce) and extract reusable principles for startup building, leadership, and execution.
