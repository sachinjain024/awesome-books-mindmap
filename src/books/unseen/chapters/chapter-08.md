One of the major moments associated with Zomato's evolution is the Uber Eats India acquisition. The strategic upside was clear: accelerated scale and stronger market position.

But acquisitions are integration tests as much as deal events. Real value depends on execution after announcement.

## Integration Realities

- Technology and operations need rapid harmonization.
- Team and culture integration can define long-term outcome.
- Competitive advantage comes from post-deal execution quality.

## Key Takeaways

- Acquisitions compress time but increase complexity.
- Deal logic must be backed by integration muscle.
- Strategic wins are completed in implementation, not in press releases.
