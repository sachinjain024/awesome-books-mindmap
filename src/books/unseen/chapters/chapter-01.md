The book opens near Zomato's 2021 IPO moment, where external validation is highest but internal uncertainty is still active. This framing matters: it resists the standard startup script where everything looks inevitable in hindsight.

By beginning at the peak and then returning to earlier phases, the narrative emphasizes process over mythology. Success appears as an accumulation of contested calls, not a smooth masterplan.

## Why This Structure Works

- It highlights the gap between public narrative and private reality.
- It keeps attention on decisions, not just outcomes.
- It shows that pressure does not end after milestones; it changes form.

### Key Insight

Milestones are visible. Method is usually hidden. This chapter points you toward method.

## Key Takeaways

- The IPO is used as an entry point, not the ending.
- Retrospective clarity can hide the uncertainty teams actually lived through.
- Understanding a company requires tracing major decisions back to their context.
