Many durable startups begin by solving a narrow, immediate problem. This chapter follows that transition from practical utility to a product that can scale beyond its initial context.

The early product thesis was simple: reduce friction in food discovery and ordering decisions. The execution challenge was not idea novelty but reliability, usability, and trust.

## What Changed the Trajectory

- A repeatable user pain point with broad relevance.
- Fast feedback loops on product experience.
- Willingness to evolve identity and positioning as the market expanded.

## Key Takeaways

- A useful product can emerge from small operational annoyances.
- Early traction depends on removing friction better than alternatives.
- Founding stories are less about epiphany, more about disciplined iteration.
