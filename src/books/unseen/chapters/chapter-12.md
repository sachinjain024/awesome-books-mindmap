The closing arc shifts from founder profile to institution design. The long-game question is not whether one person is exceptional, but whether the company can repeatedly adapt as contexts change.

This chapter emphasizes durability: structures that outlast personalities, systems that improve with scale, and strategic courage paired with operational discipline.

## Endgame Lens

- Build mechanisms, not dependency on heroics.
- Keep reinvention normal at every stage.
- Balance ambition with governance and execution hygiene.

## Key Takeaways

- The strongest startup outcome is institutional continuity.
- Enduring companies optimize for learning and renewal.
- Legacy is built through repeatable operating systems, not singular moments.
