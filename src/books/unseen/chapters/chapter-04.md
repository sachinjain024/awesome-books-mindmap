Brand and product positioning were not cosmetic decisions; they were strategic mechanisms to expand relevance and memorability. Renaming and sharper positioning aligned the company with a broader ambition.

This chapter focuses on the mechanics of early product-market fit: consistency in user value, interface simplicity, and credibility through reliable data.

### Decision Lens

A brand shift works only when product reality supports the promise.

## Key Takeaways

- Repositioning can unlock scale if it reflects actual product direction.
- Early trust compounds when users repeatedly get predictable value.
- Product-market fit is a moving target, not a one-time achievement.
