The book highlights periods where financial pressure forced hard prioritization. In these phases, optimism is not enough; operating discipline determines survival.

Constraint did not just reduce options. It clarified priorities, exposed weak assumptions, and demanded sharper execution rhythms.

- Reduce parallel bets and focus on core value drivers.
- Shorten decision cycles and tighten accountability.
- Preserve team trust while making unpopular cuts.

## Key Takeaways

- Scarcity can improve strategic precision.
- Survival phases reward clarity more than ambition language.
- Teams remember how leadership behaves when resources are thin.
