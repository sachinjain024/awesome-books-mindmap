Scaling companies run experiments that do not always work. This chapter tracks the discipline of recognizing weak trajectories early and reallocating effort.

The critical capability is not avoiding mistakes; it is exiting bad paths quickly without losing organizational learning.

## Recalibration Pattern

- Test with clear hypotheses.
- Measure quickly with decision-grade metrics.
- Keep ego out of rollback decisions.

## Key Takeaways

- Course correction is a core scaling skill.
- Strategic reversals can be signs of maturity, not weakness.
- Learning velocity matters more than narrative consistency.
