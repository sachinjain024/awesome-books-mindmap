The Blinkit deal is presented as a conviction-heavy strategic bet with significant debate around timing, economics, and integration complexity.

This chapter explores how leadership processes controversial decisions: what evidence is used, how dissent is handled, and how commitment is communicated after the call is made.

## Decision Under Ambiguity

- No major strategic bet arrives with complete information.
- Internal disagreement can improve decision quality when structured well.
- Speed after decision is as important as the decision itself.

## Key Takeaways

- High-upside moves require tolerance for short-term criticism.
- Strategic coherence depends on integrating new bets into the core model.
- Leadership credibility is tested after the announcement, during execution.
