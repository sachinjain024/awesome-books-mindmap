Going public transforms the operating environment. Decision quality is now judged by customers, employees, investors, regulators, and media on a tighter cycle.

This chapter centers on the pre-IPO shift from startup improvisation to public-company rigor: governance, financial communication, and institutional processes.

## What IPO Readiness Demands

- Repeatable reporting discipline.
- Sharper internal controls and accountability structures.
- Narrative consistency between strategy and numbers.

## Key Takeaways

- IPO is an operating transition, not just a funding event.
- Public scrutiny increases pressure for process maturity.
- Institutional trust compounds through consistency over time.
