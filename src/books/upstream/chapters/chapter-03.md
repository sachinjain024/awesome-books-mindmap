## The Three Barriers

Why, if upstream thinking is so obviously beneficial, do we spend so little time doing it? Dan Heath identifies three barriers that consistently prevent organizations and individuals from addressing problems at their source. These barriers are not excuses — they are real, structurally embedded forces that must be understood and explicitly countered.

**Barrier 1: Problem Blindness** — We literally cannot see the problem because we've normalized it.

**Barrier 2: Lack of Ownership** — Nobody sees the problem as their responsibility to solve.

**Barrier 3: Tunneling** — We're so overwhelmed by immediate crises that we cannot invest attention in long-term prevention.

Understanding each barrier is the first step to overcoming it.

## Barrier 1: Problem Blindness

Problem blindness is not ignorance — it is something subtler. It occurs when a problem is so familiar, so embedded in the daily landscape of an organization or community, that it has become invisible. People see the evidence of the problem every day without registering it as a problem that could be solved.

### An Example from Schools {.barrier-box}

A school administrator walks past lockers with no locks — students have long since given up using them because the locks were broken years ago and never replaced. The administrator has walked past these lockers hundreds of times. She no longer sees them. A visitor from another school notices them immediately and asks: "Why don't the students use their lockers?" This question breaks the spell of normalization.

Problem blindness is cured by the deliberate cultivation of fresh perspectives — bringing in people who don't share the organization's normalized assumptions, comparing against peers who have achieved better outcomes, or simply asking "what would a newcomer notice here that we've stopped seeing?"

## Barrier 2: Lack of Ownership

Many of the most important upstream problems don't belong to any single person, department, or organization. They fall between silos. They span jurisdictions. They involve multiple stakeholders with conflicting interests and different budgets.

### The Bystander Effect at Scale {.principle-box}

The classic bystander effect — where individuals in a group are less likely to help a person in distress because everyone assumes someone else will act — operates at organizational scale in upstream problems.

When a child has chronic absenteeism from school, who is responsible for solving it? The school? The parents? Child protective services? The public housing authority (if the family moves frequently)? The hospital (if the child has untreated health problems)? Each of these organizations touches the problem, but none of them owns it. They each manage their piece — the attendance records, the casework, the eviction proceedings, the medical records — without coordinating on the underlying challenge.

Solving the problem requires someone to step forward and say: "I own this." Not "I can fix it alone" — but "I will take responsibility for ensuring it gets fixed, even if that requires coordinating across systems I don't control."

## Barrier 3: Tunneling

In their landmark research on scarcity, Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir showed that people who are experiencing scarcity — of money, of time, of mental bandwidth — demonstrate a predictable pattern of behavior called "tunneling." Their attention narrows to the immediate problem. They see clearly what's directly in front of them and lose peripheral vision for everything else.

### The Tunnel Vision of Crisis {.barrier-box}

Organizations under constant firefighting pressure exhibit the same tunneling behavior. The team that is always dealing with the latest crisis has no bandwidth to think about what's causing the crises. The ER that is always at capacity has no time to study why patients keep returning. The school that is always managing behavioral incidents has no energy to build the upstream supports that would reduce behavioral incidents.

Tunneling creates a self-reinforcing trap: the more overwhelmed you are by immediate crises, the less capacity you have to invest in prevention, which means the crises continue, which means you remain overwhelmed.

Heath's prescription: to escape the tunnel, you don't need more time — you need to actively protect time from the tunnel. This means making upstream investment a non-negotiable commitment before emergencies fill the calendar.

### How the Three Barriers Compound {.insight-box}

The three barriers are not independent — they reinforce each other. Problem blindness means you don't see the problem clearly, so you can't build ownership for solving it. Lack of ownership means no one has the mandate to invest resources, so the problem continues generating crises. Those crises create tunneling, which prevents anyone from developing the clear view that would break through problem blindness.

Breaking the cycle requires attacking all three barriers simultaneously — or finding a leader who is willing to own the problem even while tunneling, and who can cultivate a fresh enough perspective to see what has been normalized.

### Reflection {.reflection}

Which of the three barriers is most dominant in your organization right now — problem blindness, lack of ownership, or tunneling? What would it take to break through that specific barrier in the next 90 days?

## Key Takeaways

- Problem blindness occurs when familiar problems become invisible through normalization — fresh eyes and comparative benchmarks are the cure
- Lack of ownership is the organizational bystander effect: when everyone assumes someone else is responsible, no one acts
- Tunneling is what happens to attention under scarcity: crisis overwhelm literally narrows our cognitive field, preventing us from thinking about prevention
- The three barriers compound each other: blindness prevents ownership, lack of ownership prevents investment, and crises caused by underinvestment create the tunneling that reinforces blindness
- Escaping the tunnel requires protected time — deliberately setting aside capacity for upstream thinking before it is consumed by the next emergency
- Upstream problems that span multiple organizations are especially vulnerable to lack of ownership — someone must explicitly claim responsibility across organizational boundaries
