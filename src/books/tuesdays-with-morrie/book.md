epigraph:
  quote: "The last class of my old professor's life took place once a week in his house, by a window in the study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink leaves. The class met on Tuesdays. No books were required. The subject was the meaning of life. It was taught from experience."

## About This Mind Map

**17 Chapters | 14 Tuesday Lessons | One Unforgettable Professor**

*Tuesdays with Morrie* is Mitch Albom's memoir of his weekly visits with Morrie Schwartz, his former college professor who is dying of ALS. What begins as a reunion becomes a final "class" on the meaning of life — no grades, no textbook, just the wisdom of a man who has learned how to die and, in doing so, has learned how to live.

This mind map distills Morrie's fourteen Tuesday lessons into an accessible, structured format. Each chapter captures the essence of one conversation — from death and fear to love and forgiveness — along with Morrie's most memorable aphorisms, the contrasts between what society teaches and what Morrie knows to be true, and reflections to help you apply these lessons to your own life.

Whether you've read the book or are encountering Morrie for the first time, this mind map serves as both a companion guide and a standalone reference for living with greater purpose, presence, and love.
