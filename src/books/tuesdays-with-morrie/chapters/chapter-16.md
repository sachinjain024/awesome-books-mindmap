    <h3>The Fourteenth Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: We Say Good-bye — The final visit, where words give way to love</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Last Visit</h2>
    <p>Mitch arrives for his fourteenth Tuesday, and this time, they both know it is the last. Morrie's body has deteriorated to the point where speaking is an enormous effort. His voice is barely a whisper. His breathing is shallow and labored. The disease has claimed nearly everything — his legs, his arms, his ability to eat, his ability to sit without support.</p>
    <p>But his eyes are alive. And his heart is open.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Beyond Words</h2>
    <p>The fourteen Tuesdays have been built on conversation — hours and hours of words, questions, answers, stories, and teachings. But on this final Tuesday, words are no longer adequate. What needs to be communicated between these two men cannot be spoken. It can only be felt.</p>
    <p>Morrie raises his hand — it trembles, the muscles barely responding — and reaches toward Mitch. It is an invitation. Not for a handshake, not for a pat on the back, but for an embrace.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Embrace</h2>
    <p>Mitch leans in and holds Morrie. The man who sixteen years ago handed his professor a briefcase and made a promise he would not keep now holds that professor's fragile, failing body in his arms and does not let go.</p>
    <p>The embrace lasts a long time. Neither of them rushes it. This is not a social hug — the quick, back-patting gesture that passes for affection in the culture Morrie has spent these Tuesdays critiquing. This is two human beings holding each other with everything they have. It is honest. It is complete. It is enough.</p>
</div>

<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>In the end, the lesson is not something Morrie says. It is something he does. He reaches out. He holds on. He loves without reservation, without embarrassment, without conditions. The final lesson is not a teaching. It is a demonstration.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>"I Love You"</h2>
    <p>Mitch tells Morrie he loves him. It is perhaps the hardest sentence he has ever spoken — not because the feeling is uncertain, but because saying it requires a vulnerability that Mitch has spent his adult life avoiding. Journalists do not say "I love you." Workaholic sports columnists do not say "I love you." Men in American culture are not supposed to say "I love you" to other men.</p>
    <p>But Mitch says it. And means it. And does not take it back.</p>
    <p>Morrie replies: he loves Mitch too. He tells Mitch that he considers him one of his sons. It is the ultimate gift — not the words themselves, but the willingness to say them plainly, without irony, without deflection, in the full knowledge that this is the last time they will see each other.</p>

    <h2>What Changed</h2>
    <p>Compare the Mitch who arrives at this last Tuesday with the Mitch who arrived at the first one. The first Mitch was a workaholic sports journalist who had spent sixteen years avoiding meaningful connection. He was uncomfortable with emotion, addicted to busyness, and living by values he had never examined.</p>
    <p>The Mitch who leaves this last visit is different. He has learned to cry. He has learned to sit with discomfort. He has learned to say "I love you" and mean it. He has examined his values and found many of them wanting. He is, in the most fundamental sense, a different person — not because Morrie fixed him, but because Morrie showed him what he was missing and gave him permission to find it.</p>
</div>

<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>Love Is the Final Word</h3>
    <p>After fourteen weeks of profound teachings — on death, money, culture, forgiveness, family, and more — the last lesson is the simplest one. Love. Not love as a concept or a philosophy, but love as an action: reaching out your hand, holding someone close, saying the words out loud. All of Morrie's teachings lead to this single point: love is the only thing that matters, and it must be expressed while there is still time.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Tape Recorder</h2>
    <p>Mitch has been bringing his tape recorder to every Tuesday. It has captured hours of Morrie's voice — his laughter, his tears, his wisdom, his jokes. These recordings will become the raw material for this book. They are Morrie's voice preserved beyond death, his love made portable, his lessons made permanent.</p>
    <p>But on this last Tuesday, Mitch turns off the recorder. Some moments are not for posterity. Some moments are just for the two people in the room.</p>

    <p>Who in your life needs to hear "I love you" — and what is stopping you from saying it today?</p>
