> "The last class of my old professor's life took place once a week in his house, by a window in the study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink leaves."
> — Mitch Albom

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Last Class</h2>
    <p><em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em> opens with an extended metaphor that frames the entire book. This is a story about a class — not in a university lecture hall, but in the study of a dying man's home. The professor is Morrie Schwartz. The student is Mitch Albom. The subject is the meaning of life.</p>
    <p>There are no grades, no final exams, no required textbooks. The only requirement is that the student must produce a long paper — this book itself — as the "final thesis." And instead of a graduation ceremony, there is a funeral.</p>
</div>

<div class="backstory">
    <h3>Brandeis, 1979</h3>
    <p>The story begins with a memory. In 1979, Mitch Albom is graduating from Brandeis University. He presents his favorite professor, Morrie Schwartz, with a monogrammed briefcase as a graduation gift. They embrace, and Mitch makes a promise: he will stay in touch.</p>
    <p>It is a promise he will not keep — at least not for sixteen years.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Student Loses His Way</h2>
    <p>After graduation, Mitch drifts away from the idealistic young man Morrie knew. He pursues a career in music, then pivots to journalism after his favorite uncle dies of pancreatic cancer. The uncle's death shakes Mitch — it is the first time he confronts mortality, and his response is to throw himself into work.</p>
    <p>Mitch becomes a successful sports columnist in Detroit. He earns good money, buys a house, fills his life with deadlines and obligations. But beneath the professional success, something is missing. He has become a workaholic, measuring his worth by his productivity rather than his relationships.</p>
</div>

<div class="metaphor-box">
    <h3>The Briefcase</h3>
    <p>The briefcase Mitch gives Morrie at graduation becomes a symbol of their different paths. Mitch fills his life with work and material pursuits — the contents of a briefcase. Morrie, who never cared much for possessions, fills his life with people, conversations, and love. The briefcase represents the career-driven life Mitch chose over the relationship-centered life Morrie modeled.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Reconnection</h2>
    <p>In the spring of 1995, Mitch is channel-surfing late at night when he sees a familiar face on ABC's <em>Nightline</em>. Ted Koppel is interviewing Morrie Schwartz, who has been diagnosed with ALS — Lou Gehrig's disease. The disease is terminal. Morrie's body is slowly shutting down.</p>
    <p>But what strikes Mitch is not Morrie's frailty. It is his spirit. Morrie is still warm, witty, and deeply engaged with life. He has decided to make his own death a teaching opportunity — a final class for anyone willing to listen.</p>
    <p>Mitch remembers his promise. He picks up the phone.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The First Visit</h2>
    <p>Mitch flies to Boston and drives to Morrie's home in West Newton, Massachusetts. He is nervous — it has been sixteen years. What do you say to a dying man you abandoned?</p>
    <p>But the moment Morrie sees Mitch, the years collapse. They embrace. Morrie cries — he cries easily and without embarrassment. They talk for hours about everything and nothing, and by the end of the visit, Morrie has made a request: come back next Tuesday.</p>
    <p>And so the class begins.</p>
</div>

    <h3>The Rules of the Class</h3>
    <p>Meet on Tuesdays. Bring food. Ask questions. No grades — just life.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Classroom</h2>
    <p>The classroom is Morrie's study — a room crowded with books, papers, and a desk by the window where a small hibiscus plant sits. Each week, Morrie is a little weaker. Each week, the conversations go a little deeper.</p>
    <p>Mitch begins bringing a tape recorder to preserve Morrie's words. He creates a list of topics they will discuss: death, fear, aging, greed, marriage, family, society, forgiveness, and how to live a meaningful life. Each Tuesday becomes a new lesson.</p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Promises Matter:</strong> Mitch's broken promise to stay in touch represents how easily we let important relationships slip away</li>
        <li><strong>Success Can Be a Trap:</strong> Material success and busyness can distract us from what truly matters</li>
        <li><strong>It's Never Too Late:</strong> Sixteen years had passed, but the reconnection happened because one person reached out</li>
        <li><strong>Death as Teacher:</strong> Morrie chose to make his dying a final act of teaching — transforming tragedy into wisdom</li>
        <li><strong>The Academic Metaphor:</strong> Life itself is the curriculum; experience is the textbook; love is the subject</li>
    </ul>

<div class="reflection">
    <p>Is there someone you've lost touch with — someone who mattered deeply to you? What would it take to pick up the phone today?</p>
