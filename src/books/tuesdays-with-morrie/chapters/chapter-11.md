    <h3>The Ninth Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: How Love Goes On — Why love transcends death and relationships endure beyond the grave</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Body Fades</h2>
    <p>Morrie's condition has deteriorated sharply. He now needs a catheter. His voice is weaker, his breathing more strained. The list of things he can no longer do grows longer every day — eating solid food, sitting upright without support, even coughing effectively. His body is becoming a prison.</p>
    <p>And yet, it is during this visit — when his physical self is at its most diminished — that Morrie speaks most powerfully about the endurance of love.</p>

    <h2>When You're in Bed, You're Dead</h2>
    <p>Morrie has a motto: "When you're in bed, you're dead." He insists on being lifted out of bed every day, moved to his study, positioned in his recliner by the window with the hibiscus plant. Even when staying in bed would be easier, more comfortable, less painful — he refuses. To stay in bed is to surrender. To get up, even when getting up requires the arms of others, is to remain alive.</p>
    <p>This is not stubbornness. It is philosophy in action. Morrie believes that living is an active verb. It requires engagement, effort, participation. The moment you stop engaging, you have already begun to die — regardless of whether your heart is still beating.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Love After Death</h2>
    <p>Morrie is not afraid of being forgotten. He knows that the love he has given throughout his life continues to exist in the people who received it. His students carry his lessons. His children carry his values. His friends carry his warmth. When he dies, these things will not die with him. They will live on, spreading outward in ways he may never see.</p>
    <p>This is what Morrie means when he says love goes on. It is not a mystical claim about the afterlife. It is a practical observation about how love works: it multiplies. Every act of genuine love creates ripples. Those ripples reach other people, who in turn create their own ripples. The original source may be gone, but the waves continue.</p>
</div>

<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>Morrie is not worried about being remembered in the way most people worry — through fame, through monuments, through accomplishments etched in stone. He is confident that his love will endure because he has invested it in people, not in things. People carry love forward. Things do not.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>A Teacher to the Last</h2>
    <p>Morrie has chosen his epitaph: "A Teacher to the Last." This is not vanity. It is the truest summary of his life and his approach to death. He has been teaching for decades — in classrooms, in conversations, in the way he lives. And now, through his willingness to die publicly and honestly, he is teaching his final and most important lesson: how to leave this world with grace, love, and meaning.</p>
    <p>The book itself is proof that Morrie's love goes on. Mitch is writing it at Morrie's suggestion. The advance from the publisher will help pay Morrie's medical bills — a practical act of love even in death. And the millions of readers who will eventually encounter these words are all, in a sense, Morrie's students.</p>

    <h3>The Ripple Effect of Love</h3>
    <p>Love is not a limited resource that ends when the lover dies. It is an energy that transfers from person to person, generation to generation. When you love someone well, you teach them what love looks like. They carry that lesson forward and love others the same way. Your love continues long after you are gone — not in memory alone, but in action.</p>

    <h2>What Morrie Leaves Behind</h2>
    <p>As his body fails, Morrie takes stock of what he is leaving behind. Not money — he has little. Not property — his house is modest. Not fame — he is a sociology professor, not a celebrity. What he leaves behind is something far more durable: the impact of a life lived in service to others.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>His students</strong> carry his intellectual curiosity and his challenge to question society's assumptions</li>
        <li><strong>His children</strong> carry his emotional openness, his willingness to cry, his insistence on expressing love</li>
        <li><strong>His friends</strong> carry his warmth, his humor, his gift for making people feel seen</li>
        <li><strong>This book</strong> carries his wisdom to millions who never met him</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Leave a Legacy</h4>
        <p>Build something that lasts — a company, a fortune, a reputation. Be remembered for your achievements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="morrie-teaches">
        <h4>Leave Love</h4>
        <p>Invest in people. The love you give lives on in them. A legacy of love outlasts any monument.</p>
