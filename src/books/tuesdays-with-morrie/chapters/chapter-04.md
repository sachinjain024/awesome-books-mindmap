    <h3>The Second Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: Feeling Sorry for Yourself — How much self-pity is allowed, and when to stop</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Morning Ritual</h2>
    <p>Mitch asks Morrie the question everyone wants to ask a dying person but rarely does: Don't you feel sorry for yourself?</p>
    <p>Morrie's answer is disarmingly honest. Yes, he does. Every morning, he allows himself a small window of self-pity. He wakes up, feels the weight of what is happening to his body, and mourns. Sometimes he cries. He lets the grief wash over him — completely, without resistance.</p>
    <p>Then he stops.</p>

    <h2>The Discipline of Grief</h2>
    <p>What makes Morrie's approach remarkable is its discipline. He does not deny his suffering. He does not pretend to be brave or above self-pity. But he also refuses to let it consume him. He has created a practice — almost a meditation — where he gives grief its due and then deliberately turns his attention elsewhere.</p>
    <p>After his morning tears, Morrie watches the news. He sees people in far worse situations — refugees, victims of violence, the desperately poor. Not as a way of minimizing his own pain, but as a way of regaining perspective. There are others who are suffering more. There are still things to be grateful for.</p>
</div>

<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>Self-Pity in Small Doses</h3>
    <p>Morrie does not condemn self-pity — he contains it. The lesson is not "never feel sorry for yourself." It is: feel it, honor it, and then choose to move forward. Self-pity becomes destructive only when it becomes a permanent address rather than a brief visit.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>What Morrie Still Has</h2>
    <p>After each morning's grief, Morrie takes inventory of what remains. He can still think clearly. He can still speak. He can still love and be loved. People visit him — students, friends, family. His mind is sharp, his humor is intact, his capacity for connection is undiminished.</p>
    <p>He lists these things not as consolation prizes, but as genuine riches. Many people who have full use of their bodies do not have what Morrie has: deep relationships, a sense of purpose, the ability to give and receive love freely.</p>

    <div class="society-says">
        <h4>Suppress or Wallow</h4>
        <p>Society offers two options: either deny your pain entirely ("stay positive!") or surrender to it completely. Neither works.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="morrie-teaches">
        <h4>Feel, Then Redirect</h4>
        <p>Honor your grief each day, then deliberately turn toward gratitude. Self-pity needs a time limit, not a prohibition.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Danger of Wallowing</h2>
    <p>Morrie has seen what happens to people who let self-pity take over. They close down. They push others away. They stop noticing what they still have because they are consumed by what they have lost. Their world shrinks to the size of their complaint.</p>
    <p>Morrie refuses this path. Even as his world physically shrinks — he can no longer drive, walk, or even sit up without help — his emotional and intellectual world remains vast. He keeps up with the news, engages visitors in deep conversation, and thinks about other people's problems as much as his own.</p>
</div>

<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>The key is not to eliminate pain but to prevent it from defining you. Morrie's morning ritual acknowledges the reality of his situation while refusing to let it become the whole of his reality. This is not toxic positivity — it is earned perspective from a man who has every reason to despair and chooses not to.</p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acknowledge Your Pain:</strong> Morrie does not suppress grief — he gives it a dedicated space each morning</li>
        <li><strong>Set a Time Limit:</strong> Feel sorry for yourself, then deliberately shift your focus to what remains good</li>
        <li><strong>Perspective Is a Practice:</strong> Looking at others' suffering is not about minimizing yours — it is about maintaining proportion</li>
        <li><strong>Gratitude Requires Inventory:</strong> Actively listing what you still have is more powerful than vaguely "being grateful"</li>
        <li><strong>Wallowing Shrinks Your World:</strong> Unchecked self-pity pushes people away and blinds you to remaining joys</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="reflection">
    <p>What would it look like to give yourself five minutes of honest grieving each morning — and then deliberately turn toward what is good in your life?</p>
