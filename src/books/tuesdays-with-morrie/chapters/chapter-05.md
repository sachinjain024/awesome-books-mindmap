    <h3>The Third Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: Regrets — How people focus on the wrong things, and the importance of finding a guide</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Walking Through Life Asleep</h2>
    <p>On this Tuesday, Mitch brings a tape recorder for the first time. He wants to preserve Morrie's words. Morrie agrees without hesitation — he wants his wisdom to outlive him.</p>
    <p>The conversation turns to regret — not Morrie's personal regrets, but the collective regret of an entire culture. Morrie observes that most people spend their lives pursuing things that do not matter. They chase status, accumulate possessions, climb ladders that lean against the wrong walls. And they do all of this in a kind of sleepwalk, never stopping to question whether their direction is right.</p>

    So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important.

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Wrong Priorities</h2>
    <p>Morrie sees a culture in which people have accepted a set of priorities that do not serve them. They work jobs they do not love to buy things they do not need to impress people they do not like. They sacrifice relationships for career advancement. They postpone happiness to some future date that never arrives.</p>
    <p>The tragedy is not that people are lazy or irresponsible. It is that they are busy — incredibly, exhaustingly busy — with the wrong things. They are efficient at tasks that do not matter and negligent of the things that do.</p>
</div>

<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>Busyness Is Not Purpose</h3>
    <p>There is a crucial difference between being busy and being purposeful. Morrie watches Mitch — a man who fills every hour with work, who carries a phone and a pager and a schedule crammed with obligations — and sees someone who is running so fast that he has forgotten where he is going. Activity without reflection is just noise.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Need for Teachers</h2>
    <p>Morrie believes that people need teachers — not just in school, but throughout life. Not teachers in the formal sense, but guides who can help redirect your attention when you have wandered off course. Someone who can look at your life from the outside and say, gently but firmly, "You are focusing on the wrong things."</p>
    <p>This is what Morrie does for Mitch. He does not criticize Mitch's career or lifestyle. He simply holds up a mirror and asks Mitch to look honestly at what he sees. Is this the life you imagined? Is this what you want written on your tombstone?</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-box">
    <h4>The Mirror</h4>
    <div class="dialogue-line morrie">
        <span class="speaker">Morrie:</span> Mitch, the culture doesn't encourage you to think about these things until you're about to die. We're so wrapped up in egotistical things — career, family, having enough money, meeting the mortgage, getting a new car — we don't get into the habit of standing back and looking at our lives and saying, "Is this all? Is this all I want? Is something missing?"
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-line mitch">
        <span class="speaker">Mitch:</span> (Listens silently, uncomfortable with how accurately this describes his own life)
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The List</h2>
    <p>During this visit, Mitch creates a list of topics he wants to discuss with Morrie in the weeks ahead. The list becomes the syllabus for their remaining Tuesdays together:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Death</strong> — How to face it without fear</li>
        <li><strong>Fear</strong> — What we are really afraid of</li>
        <li><strong>Aging</strong> — Why we resist it</li>
        <li><strong>Greed</strong> — Why we want more than we need</li>
        <li><strong>Marriage</strong> — What makes it last</li>
        <li><strong>Family</strong> — Why nothing can replace it</li>
        <li><strong>Society</strong> — Why it fails us</li>
        <li><strong>Forgiveness</strong> — Why we need it</li>
        <li><strong>A meaningful life</strong> — How to live one</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these topics will become the subject of a future Tuesday.</p>
</div>

<div class="morrie-wisdom">
    <p>The antidote to regret is not perfection — it is awareness. You cannot go back and unlive the years you spent chasing the wrong things. But you can wake up today. You can look at your life honestly and ask whether your daily actions align with your deepest values. And if they don't, you can change course. As long as you are breathing, it is not too late.</p>
</div>

<div class="key-points">
    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Most People Sleepwalk:</strong> We fill our lives with activity but rarely stop to ask whether it is meaningful</li>
        <li><strong>Busyness Is Not Purpose:</strong> Being productive and being purposeful are not the same thing</li>
        <li><strong>We Need Guides:</strong> Everyone benefits from someone who can redirect their attention to what truly matters</li>
        <li><strong>The Right Questions:</strong> "Is this all I want?" is more important than "How do I get more?"</li>
        <li><strong>Awareness Is the Antidote:</strong> Regret comes from unconscious living; the cure is waking up and choosing differently</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="reflection">
    <p>If you stood back from your life today and looked at it honestly — the way you spend your time, the things you prioritize — would you be satisfied with what you see? What would you change?</p>
