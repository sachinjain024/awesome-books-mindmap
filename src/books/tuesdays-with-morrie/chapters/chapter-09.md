    <h3>The Seventh Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Topic: The Fear of Aging — Why growing older is a gift, not a curse</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>A New Kind of Dependence</h2>
    <p>Morrie's condition has progressed to the point where he needs help with everything. He cannot use the bathroom alone. He cannot wipe himself. These are the indignities that most people dread about aging and illness — the loss of autonomy, the loss of privacy, the humiliation of needing someone to perform your most basic bodily functions.</p>
    <p>But Morrie is not humiliated. He is, in his way, at peace with it.</p>
</div>

<div class="metaphor-box">
    <h3>Returning to Childhood</h3>
    <p>Morrie reframes his dependence as a return to infancy. As a baby, someone bathed him, fed him, wiped him, and held him. He did not feel ashamed then because he was surrounded by love. Now, at the end of his life, the same thing is happening — and if he is surrounded by love again, why should he feel ashamed now? Dependence is not degradation when it happens within the context of love.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Culture's War on Aging</h2>
    <p>Morrie takes aim at one of American culture's most deeply held values: the worship of youth. We idolize the young. We spend billions on products that promise to reverse aging. We treat growing old as a failure — a decline from the ideal of youth rather than a progression toward wisdom.</p>
    <p>Morrie finds this absurd. Why would you envy the young? They are confused, insecure, uncertain about who they are. They lack perspective. They make the same mistakes that every generation makes because they do not yet have the experience to avoid them.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Gift of Years</h2>
    <p>Morrie argues that aging brings gifts that youth cannot offer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Perspective:</strong> You have seen enough of life to distinguish what matters from what doesn't</li>
        <li><strong>Self-knowledge:</strong> You know who you are — your strengths, your limitations, your values</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional depth:</strong> Your capacity for empathy and understanding deepens with experience</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> You waste less time on superficiality because you have learned its emptiness</li>
        <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> You make peace with imperfection — yours and others'</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>On Being Any Age</h4>
    <div class="dialogue-line mitch">
        <span class="speaker">Mitch:</span> Do you ever wish you were young again?
    </div>
    <div class="dialogue-line morrie">
        <span class="speaker">Morrie:</span> I embrace aging. It's very simple. As you grow, you learn more. Aging is not just decay, you know. It's growth. It's more than the negative that you're going to die, it's also the positive that you understand you're going to die, and that you live a better life because of it.
    </div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Containing Every Age</h2>
    <p>One of Morrie's most beautiful insights is that old people are not just old — they contain within them every age they have ever been. Morrie at seventy-eight still carries within him the eight-year-old boy who lost his mother, the young man who lay down on the floor beside a mental patient, the professor who danced every Wednesday evening.</p>
    <p>He can access any of these selves. He can remember what it felt like to be young, to be middle-aged, to be in his prime. He has not lost those ages — he has accumulated them. Each one is a layer, and the whole is richer than any single part.</p>
</div>

<div class="life-lesson">
    <h3>Aging as Accumulation</h3>
    <p>We think of aging as loss — loss of beauty, loss of strength, loss of independence. Morrie reframes it as accumulation. You do not lose your youth when you age. You add to it. Every year is another layer of experience, understanding, and wisdom. An old person is not a diminished young person. They are a young person plus decades of living.</p>
</div>

<div class="contrast">
    <div class="society-says">
        <h4>Youth Is the Ideal</h4>
        <p>Stay young as long as possible. Fight aging. The best years are behind you. Getting old is a loss.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="morrie-teaches">
        <h4>Aging Is Growth</h4>
        <p>Embrace every age. Each decade brings deeper understanding. You contain all the ages you've ever been. Growing old is gaining, not losing.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>The Envy Trap</h2>
    <p>Mitch notices that Morrie does not envy the young. He does not watch young people jogging past his window and feel bitterness about what he can no longer do. Instead, he watches them with a kind of knowing tenderness — he has been where they are, and he knows what they have yet to learn.</p>
    <p>This lack of envy is remarkable in a man who cannot move his own body. It comes from a genuine belief that his current position — despite its physical limitations — offers something that youth cannot: understanding. Morrie knows things now that he could not have known at twenty-five or forty or sixty. And that knowledge is worth more than functioning legs.</p>
</div>

<div class="key-points">
    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Aging Is Growth:</strong> Getting older is not decline — it is the accumulation of experience, perspective, and wisdom</li>
        <li><strong>Dependence Within Love:</strong> Needing help is not shameful when you are surrounded by people who love you</li>
        <li><strong>You Contain Every Age:</strong> An old person carries within them every age they have ever been — each is accessible</li>
        <li><strong>Stop Fighting the Inevitable:</strong> Battling against aging guarantees unhappiness; embracing it brings peace</li>
        <li><strong>Youth Worship Is a Trap:</strong> Envying the young means devaluing the wisdom you have earned through living</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="reflection">
    <p>What has aging given you that you could not have had when you were younger? What do you understand now that you couldn't understand then?</p>
