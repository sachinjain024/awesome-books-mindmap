## About This Book

**A Man Called Ove** follows a rigid, rule-bound widower who believes his life has ended with his wife's death. As new neighbors, old obligations, and small daily responsibilities keep interrupting his isolation, Ove is gradually pulled back into relationship and purpose.

This mind map traces Ove's emotional arc from grief and withdrawal to reluctant belonging. It highlights the novel's core ideas about usefulness, community, loss, and the possibility of second chances at any age.
