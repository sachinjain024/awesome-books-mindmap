## The Grumpy Man

Ove is fifty-nine. He has strict rules about parking, trash, and the right way to do things. His wife Sonja has died, he has been forced to retire, and he no longer sees a reason to stay alive.

The novel first shows Ove's hard surface: stubborn, judgmental, and angry at a changing world. Beneath that surface is grief and a man who once loved deeply.

## Key Takeaways

- Rigidity can hide grief and a deep need for meaning.
- Loss can make the future feel unnecessary.
- Human connection often begins by interruption, not intention.
