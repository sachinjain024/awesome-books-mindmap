## How Ove Became Ove

The story fills in Ove's history: early loss, strict values from his father, hardship, meeting Sonja, and later caring for her through severe illness and disability.

When Sonja dies, Ove's life structure collapses. His desire to die is tied to loyalty, grief, and the absence of purpose.

"Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the greatest motivations for living."

## Key Takeaways

- Present behavior is often legible through past loss.
- Grief can look like anger or withdrawal.
- New purpose does not erase old love; it coexists with it.
