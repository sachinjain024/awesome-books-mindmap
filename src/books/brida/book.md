## About This Book

*Brida* (1990) is Paulo Coelho's enchanting tale of a young Irish woman's spiritual awakening and quest for magical knowledge. At twenty-one, Brida is drawn to the mysteries of spirituality and begins a transformative journey that will introduce her to two different paths of wisdom and ultimately to herself.

Meeting Magus by the River Liffey, Brida begins her initiation into the Tradition of the Sun—a path of active spiritual knowledge, courage, and direct experience. Through challenging exercises and profound teachings, she learns to overcome fear and recognize the sacred power within herself and all living things. Yet she senses there is more to discover, another dimension of knowledge that calls to her through intuition rather than reason.

The discovery of Wicca, a mysterious wise woman, opens the door to the Tradition of the Moon—a path emphasizing intuition, cycles, feminine wisdom, and connection to the hidden dimensions of reality. As Brida deepens her spiritual practice, she also falls in love with Lorens, a young man who challenges her to reconcile love and spiritual growth. Through her journey, she learns about soul mates—the spiritual connections that bind certain souls together across lifetimes for purposes of mutual evolution and awakening.

*Brida* is a beautiful meditation on finding your true self, integrating the masculine and feminine aspects of consciousness, trusting your intuition, and recognizing that authentic power comes from wholeness. Like all of Coelho's works, it combines accessibility with depth, offering profound spiritual truths wrapped in an engaging narrative that speaks to seekers at every stage of their journey.
