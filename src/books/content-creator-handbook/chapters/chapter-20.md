## The Audio Priority

This counterintuitive truth has been validated repeatedly: viewers tolerate mediocre video but abandon bad audio instantly. Echo, background noise, inconsistent levels, harsh frequencies — any of these will drive people away.

Why? Audio is processed differently by our brains. Bad video is disappointing. Bad audio is physically unpleasant and fatiguing to listen to.

### Audio Quality Checklist {.strategy-box}

- **Clarity:** Every word is easily understandable
- **Consistency:** Levels don't jump around
- **No echo:** Room doesn't sound hollow or reverberant
- **No background noise:** AC, traffic, fans are inaudible
- **Natural tone:** Voice sounds like the person, not processed/tinny

## Microphone Types

| Type | Best For | Pros / Cons |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Built-in camera/phone mic | Last resort only | Convenient / Picks up everything, hollow sound |
| Lavalier (clip-on) | Interviews, vlogging | Consistent level / Visible, can rustle |
| Shotgun | On-camera mounting | Directional, good reach / Requires positioning |
| USB condenser | Desk setups, podcasts | Great quality / Stationary, picks up room |
| Dynamic | Podcasts, noisy rooms | Rejects background noise / Need to be close |

## Room Treatment Basics

Even a great microphone sounds bad in a reverberant room. Treat your space:

- **Soft surfaces:** Curtains, carpets, upholstered furniture absorb sound
- **Avoid hard parallel surfaces:** These create flutter echo
- **Closet trick:** Recording in a closet full of clothes works surprisingly well
- **Acoustic panels:** Professional solution, or DIY with dense foam
- **Get close to the mic:** Less room, more voice

### Common Mistake: Expensive Mic, Untreated Room {.common-mistake}

A ₹30,000 microphone in a room with hard walls and echo will sound worse than a ₹3,000 microphone in a treated space. Fix your room before upgrading your mic. A blanket behind you makes more difference than a new microphone.

## Audio Post-Processing

Basic audio cleanup in post:

- **Noise reduction:** Remove consistent background hum
- **Normalization:** Bring levels to consistent standard
- **Compression:** Even out volume differences
- **EQ:** Cut muddiness (around 200-400Hz), add presence (2-5kHz)
- **De-essing:** Reduce harsh "s" sounds if needed

But remember: post-processing can't fix fundamentally bad audio. Get it right in recording.

### Pro Tip {.pro-tip}

Always monitor with headphones while recording. You'll catch problems (echo, noise, clipping) in real-time instead of discovering them in editing when it's too late.

### Action Steps {.action-step}

- Record a test clip and listen critically with headphones — what do you hear?
- Clap in your recording space — if you hear echo, treat the room
- Get the mic closer to your mouth — experiment with placement
- Invest in at least a basic external microphone (lavalier or USB)

## Key Takeaways

- Viewers tolerate bad video but abandon bad audio
- Room treatment matters as much as microphone quality
- Get the mic close, monitor with headphones, control the environment
- Different mic types suit different content formats
- Post-processing helps but can't fix fundamentally bad recordings
