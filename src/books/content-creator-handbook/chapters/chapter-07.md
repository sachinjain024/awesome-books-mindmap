## One Goal: Session Time

YouTube's business model is simple: show ads to viewers. To show more ads, they need viewers to watch more. The algorithm's entire purpose is to maximize how long people stay on the platform.

This means the algorithm promotes content that:

- Gets clicked (brings viewers to the platform)
- Gets watched (keeps viewers on the platform)
- Leads to more watching (triggers more sessions)

### The Key Metrics YouTube Watches {.strategy-box}

- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** What percentage of people who see your video click on it
- **Average View Duration (AVD):** How long people watch on average
- **Average Percentage Viewed (APV):** What portion of your video they watch
- **Session Time:** How much total YouTube time your video triggers

## The Algorithm's Testing Process

When you publish a video, YouTube shows it to a small sample of your subscribers and people with relevant interests. Based on how that sample responds, YouTube decides whether to push it wider.

The testing stages:

1. **Stage 1:** Shown to ~100-500 people (often subscribers)
2. **Stage 2:** If CTR and AVD are good, pushed to ~1,000-5,000
3. **Stage 3:** Good performance = pushed to broader audience segments
4. **Stage 4:** Strong videos get browse/suggested placement

### CTR × AVD {.metric-box}

The simplified formula for algorithmic success

## Traffic Sources Explained

- **Browse features:** YouTube homepage — high CTR + AVD gets you here
- **Suggested videos:** Sidebar and end screens — topic relevance + engagement
- **Search:** YouTube SEO — keyword relevance + video performance
- **External:** From social media, websites, etc. — you control this
- **Notifications:** Subscribers with bell enabled — subscriber loyalty

### Common Mistake: Optimizing for One Metric {.common-mistake}

Clickbait thumbnails boost CTR but tank retention. Boring intros protect watch time but kill CTR. The algorithm wants both — click-worthy AND watch-worthy. Optimizing one at the expense of the other doesn't work.

## The Real Truth About "Beating" the Algorithm

You don't beat the algorithm — you align with it. The algorithm wants to surface content viewers will love. If you make content viewers genuinely love, you and the algorithm are on the same team.

Stop asking "what does the algorithm want?" and start asking "what does my audience want?" The answers are usually the same.

### Pro Tip {.pro-tip}

Check your Analytics → Audience → When Your Viewers Are On YouTube. Publishing when your audience is online gives you a better first-hour performance, which helps the algorithm's initial testing.

### Action Steps {.action-step}

- Study your Analytics dashboard — especially CTR, AVD, and traffic sources
- For your top 5 videos, note what CTR and AVD they achieved
- For your bottom 5, identify where the metrics fell short
- Look for patterns in what the algorithm rewards for YOUR content

## Key Takeaways

- The algorithm exists to maximize viewer session time
- CTR and AVD are the two most critical metrics
- YouTube tests videos in stages — early performance determines reach
- Clickbait without substance doesn't work long-term
- Align with the algorithm by making content viewers genuinely love
