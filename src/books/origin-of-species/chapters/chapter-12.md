> "On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the same areas, is at once explained."
> — Charles Darwin

Darwin continues his exploration of biogeography, now examining freshwater species, oceanic islands, and the remarkable effects of glacial periods. Each pattern he explores reinforces the same conclusion: species distributions are explained by history—by descent, dispersal, and modification—not by independent creation suited to each environment.

## Freshwater Species

Freshwater habitats present an interesting puzzle: lakes and rivers are isolated from each other, yet freshwater species are often widely distributed.

### The Freshwater Paradox {.observation-box}

- Lakes and rivers are separated by land—barriers for aquatic organisms
- Yet many freshwater fish, plants, and invertebrates have wide distributions
- The same species may occur in disconnected watersheds

How do freshwater species disperse across land?

### Mechanisms of Freshwater Dispersal {.example-box}

- **Flooding:** Rivers occasionally connect during floods
- **Birds:** Wading birds carry eggs, small organisms, and seeds on feet and feathers
- **Wind:** Dried ponds leave eggs and seeds that can be blown to new waters
- **Past connections:** Watersheds that are now separate were once connected

Darwin conducted experiments showing that snail eggs, fish eggs, and aquatic plant seeds could survive being dried and later transported.

## Oceanic Islands: Further Evidence

Darwin elaborates on oceanic islands, which provide crucial evidence for evolution:

### What Oceanic Islands Lack {.observation-box}

- **No native land mammals** (except bats, which can fly)
- **No amphibians** (cannot tolerate salt water)
- **Often no indigenous freshwater fish**

These are exactly the groups that cannot disperse across oceans. Their absence confirms that island species arrived by dispersal, not by creation in place.

### What Oceanic Islands Have {.observation-box}

- **Birds:** Can fly to islands
- **Insects:** Can be blown by storms
- **Plants:** Seeds can float or be carried by birds
- **Reptiles:** Some can survive salt water or rafting

## Endemic Species on Islands

Islands are famous for unique species found nowhere else:

### Endemic Species {.definition-box}

Species found only in one location. Oceanic islands often have high proportions of endemic species because their isolation allows colonizers to evolve in new directions without competition from continental relatives.

### Why Islands Have Endemics {.argument-box}

- Colonizers arrive and find empty niches
- Isolation prevents gene flow with mainland populations
- New selective pressures favor novel adaptations
- Over time, island populations diverge into distinct species

This explains both the uniqueness of island species and their similarity to mainland forms—they're modified descendants of mainland colonizers.

## The Effects of Glacial Periods

Darwin discusses how ice ages dramatically affected species distributions:

### Glacial Migration {.insight-box}

During ice ages, arctic species spread southward as temperatures dropped. When glaciers retreated, some populations became isolated on mountaintops—"islands" of cold habitat in a warming world. This explains why similar alpine species occur on disconnected mountain ranges.

### Alpine Species Distribution {.example-box}

- Same or similar species occur on Alps, Pyrenees, and Scandinavian mountains
- Similar arctic and alpine floras across northern continents
- Mountain peaks harbor relict populations from glacial times

This once-puzzling pattern makes perfect sense when viewed historically: species that were once continuous became fragmented as climates changed.

## Analogies Between Isolated Regions

Darwin notes that isolated regions often show similar patterns of unique forms:

### Parallel Patterns {.observation-box}

- Australia has many endemic species and genera
- Madagascar has unique fauna resembling African ancestors but distinct
- New Zealand has ancient lineages found nowhere else
- Each isolated landmass is a natural experiment in independent evolution

## Summary: Geography Supports Evolution

Darwin synthesizes the biogeographic evidence:

### The Case from Geography {.argument-box}

- Distributions are explained by barriers and dispersal, not by suitable environments
- Species in each region are related regardless of habitat
- Island species resemble nearby mainland forms
- Islands lack groups that cannot disperse across oceans
- Endemic species result from isolation and divergence
- Past climate changes explain current distributions

Every one of these patterns follows from evolution and common descent. None is explained by—or even expected from—independent creation.

## Key Takeaways

- Freshwater species disperse via floods, birds, and past connections
- Oceanic islands lack mammals and amphibians—groups that can't disperse across oceans
- Endemic species result from isolation allowing divergence from mainland ancestors
- Ice ages explain the current distribution of alpine and arctic species
- Each isolated landmass shows independent evolution from ancestral colonizers
- Biogeographic patterns are powerful evidence for descent with modification
