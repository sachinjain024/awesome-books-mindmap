epigraph:
  quote: "There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."

sections:
  - title: PART I - VARIATION & SELECTION
    chapters:
      - number: 1
        title: Variation Under Domestication
        description: How breeders create new varieties through artificial selection. Darwin uses pigeons, dogs, and plants to show the immense variability in domesticated species.

      - number: 2
        title: Variation Under Nature
        description: Individual differences exist in wild species too. Darwin examines the blurry line between varieties and species, suggesting they are stages in a continuum.

      - number: 3
        title: Struggle for Existence
        description: More individuals are born than can survive. This competition for limited resources creates the pressure that drives natural selection.

      - number: 4
        title: Natural Selection
        description: The core of Darwin's theory—beneficial variations are preserved, harmful ones eliminated. Includes sexual selection and the divergence of character.

  - title: PART II - LAWS & DIFFICULTIES
    chapters:
      - number: 5
        title: Laws of Variation
        description: What causes variation? Darwin explores use and disuse, correlated growth, and how environmental conditions affect organisms across generations.

      - number: 6
        title: Difficulties on Theory
        description: Darwin honestly addresses objections—missing transitional forms, organs of extreme perfection like the eye, and seemingly useless structures.

  - title: PART III - INSTINCT & HYBRIDISM
    chapters:
      - number: 7
        title: Instinct
        description: Can complex behaviors evolve? Darwin examines slave-making ants, hive-building bees, and the cuckoo's parasitic instincts as products of natural selection.

      - number: 8
        title: Hybridism
        description: Why are hybrids often sterile? Darwin argues this isn't a special barrier but an incidental result of differences that accumulated during separation.

  - title: PART IV - GEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE
    chapters:
      - number: 9
        title: On the Imperfection of the Geological Record
        description: Why don't we find endless transitional fossils? Darwin explains how rare fossilization is and why the geological record is inherently incomplete.

      - number: 10
        title: On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings
        description: The fossil record, despite gaps, shows patterns consistent with descent with modification—gradual change, extinction, and the appearance of related forms.

  - title: PART V - GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
    chapters:
      - number: 11
        title: Geographical Distribution
        description: Why are similar environments inhabited by different species? Darwin explores barriers, migration, and how species spread from centers of origin.

      - number: 12
        title: Geographical Distribution (Continued)
        description: Oceanic islands, freshwater species, and alpine floras reveal migration patterns and the profound effects of geological change on species distribution.

  - title: PART VI - CLASSIFICATION & CONCLUSION
    chapters:
      - number: 13
        title: Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings
        description: Classification, morphology, embryology, and rudimentary organs all make sense under descent with modification. The "Tree of Life" as the natural system.

      - number: 14
        title: Recapitulation and Conclusion
        description: Darwin summarizes his arguments, addresses remaining difficulties, and envisions the future of biology under the light of evolution.

keyTeachings:
  - principle: "Variation:"
    description: Individuals within a species differ from one another in countless ways—no two organisms are exactly alike.

  - principle: "Inheritance:"
    description: Offspring tend to resemble their parents; variations can be passed down through generations.

  - principle: "Struggle for Existence:"
    description: More individuals are born than can survive; resources are limited, creating intense competition.

  - principle: "Natural Selection:"
    description: Individuals with beneficial variations survive and reproduce more successfully, passing traits to offspring.

  - principle: "Descent with Modification:"
    description: Over vast time, small changes accumulate, producing new varieties and ultimately new species.

  - principle: "Common Ancestry:"
    description: All life shares a common origin; species are related through branching descent—the Tree of Life.

  - principle: "Gradualism:"
    description: Evolution proceeds through the accumulation of small, successive changes over immense geological time.

  - principle: "Divergence of Character:"
    description: Natural selection favors variants that differ most from their ancestors and from each other.

## About This Book

This mind map presents Charles Darwin's revolutionary work that introduced the scientific theory of evolution by natural selection. Published in 1859 after over 20 years of research, this book fundamentally changed our understanding of life on Earth.

Darwin meticulously builds his argument through observations from domestication, nature, geology, and biogeography, addressing objections along the way and culminating in a unified theory of descent with modification.

The book proceeds logically: first showing that variation exists (domestication), then that it exists in nature, then that competition for survival is universal, then that this inevitably leads to selection of beneficial traits. Darwin then addresses difficulties, examines instinct and hybridism, consults the geological record, explores geographical distribution, and finally unites all biology under the principle of common descent.
