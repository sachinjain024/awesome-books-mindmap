keyTeachings:
  - principle: "Build-Measure-Learn:"
    description: The fundamental feedback loop that powers all startup progress. Build an MVP, measure customer response, learn from the data, and iterate.

  - principle: "Validated Learning:"
    description: Progress in a startup is measured by validated learning about customers, not by creating features or hitting milestones.

  - principle: "Minimum Viable Product:"
    description: The fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn loop. Start with the simplest version that lets you start learning.

  - principle: "Innovation Accounting:"
    description: A new way to measure progress when traditional metrics fail. Focus on actionable metrics, not vanity metrics.

  - principle: "Pivot or Persevere:"
    description: Regularly evaluate whether to change direction (pivot) or stay the course. A structured change designed to test a new hypothesis.

  - principle: "Small Batches:"
    description: Working in small batches to reduce cycle time and get feedback faster. Continuous deployment enables rapid iteration.

  - principle: "Engines of Growth:"
    description: "Three sustainable engines: sticky (retention), viral (word-of-mouth), and paid (customer acquisition). Focus on one at a time."

  - principle: "Five Whys:"
    description: Ask "why" five times to get to the root cause of problems. Make proportional investments to fix issues at their source.

## About This Book

The Lean Startup revolutionized how companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries introduces a methodology that applies scientific experimentation to entrepreneurship.

The core framework is Build-Measure-Learn: build a Minimum Viable Product, measure customer response, learn from the data, and iterate. This approach replaces wasteful "build it and they will come" with validated learning—testing assumptions quickly and cheaply before betting the company.

This mind map presents the core Build-Measure-Learn framework and the principles for creating a successful startup through validated learning, rapid iteration, and customer feedback. From defining what a startup is to understanding engines of growth, from pivoting effectively to building adaptive organizations, Ries provides a complete methodology for navigating uncertainty.
