## About This Book

**This Book Won't Teach You Parenting** is a practical, emotionally honest guide for caregivers who are tired of impossible standards and conflicting advice. Instead of offering rigid formulas, it helps you understand what is happening inside both you and your child during everyday conflicts, transitions, and tough conversations.

This mind map translates the book into clear, actionable themes: self-awareness, co-regulation, boundaries, listening, discipline, and family culture. The goal is not to "win" parenting moments, but to build a home where children feel safe, guided, and respected while adults stay grounded and human.
