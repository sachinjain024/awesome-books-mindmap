## About This Book

Simon Sinek explores why some organizations inspire fierce loyalty while others struggle with turnover and distrust. Drawing on biology, anthropology, and real-world examples, Sinek reveals that great leaders create a "Circle of Safety" where people feel valued and protected.

When leaders prioritize the wellbeing of their people, trust forms naturally. Teams cooperate willingly, innovation flourishes, and people give their discretionary effort. But when leaders treat people as numbers or prioritize short-term gains over human needs, cortisol floods the system, trust erodes, and organizations fracture from within.

This mind map presents Sinek's insights on trust, cooperation, and what makes teams thrive. From the neuroscience of leadership chemicals to practical examples of companies that got it right (and wrong), you'll discover why the best leaders always eat last.
