A deeper dive into the four chemicals and how they interact. Understanding E.D.S.O. helps explain why some workplace practices build trust while others destroy it.

## How Leaders Can Use E.D.S.O.

### Trigger Serotonin {.principle-box}

- Public recognition and praise
- Celebrating achievements
- Showing respect and gratitude
- Making people feel valued

- Acts of kindness and generosity
- Building personal connections
- Creating shared experiences

## The Danger of Dopamine Addiction

Dopamine is designed to be addictive—it's how evolution ensured we'd keep achieving. But modern life offers unlimited dopamine sources:

### Dopamine Overload {.warning-box}

- Social media likes and notifications
- Email inbox zero
- Hitting quarterly targets
- Closing deals
- Shopping and consumption

The problem: dopamine hits feel good but don't create lasting satisfaction. We need oxytocin for that.

## Why Oxytocin Matters Most

Of all the chemicals, oxytocin is perhaps most important for organizations. It's what creates trust, loyalty, and cooperation.

### The Oxytocin Effect {.safety-box}

- Inhibits the addictive effects of dopamine
- Reduces anxiety and stress
- Increases empathy and trust
- Promotes generous behavior
- Strengthens immune system
- Creates lasting satisfaction (unlike dopamine)

## Key Takeaways

- Dopamine drives achievement but can become addictive
- Serotonin creates the pride of recognition and status
- Oxytocin builds trust, loyalty, and cooperation
- Leaders can intentionally trigger serotonin (recognition) and oxytocin (connection)
- Oxytocin is the antidote to dopamine addiction
- Modern work often over-indexes on dopamine, under-indexes on oxytocin
