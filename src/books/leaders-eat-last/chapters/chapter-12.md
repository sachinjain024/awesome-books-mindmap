Leadership is not a rank or title. It's a choice—the choice to look after the person to your left and the person to your right. This final chapter provides a path forward for anyone who wants to lead.

## Leadership Is a Choice

You don't need permission or a title to be a leader. You just need to start taking care of those around you.

### Anyone Can Lead {.principle-box}

- Look after your teammates
- Protect others from harm
- Share credit, take blame
- Put the group before yourself
- Create safety for those around you

## Building Your Circle of Safety

Start small. You can't fix an entire organization overnight, but you can create safety for your immediate team.

### How to Begin {.safety-box}

1. **Be present:** Put away devices, give people your attention
2. **Listen:** Really hear what people are saying
3. **Show you care:** Small acts of kindness build oxytocin
4. **Admit mistakes:** Vulnerability creates safety
5. **Give credit:** Recognize others' contributions
6. **Protect your people:** Shield them from internal threats

## The Ripple Effect

When you create safety for those around you, they feel empowered to do the same for others. Trust spreads.

### How Change Happens {.concept-box}

You don't need to be CEO to change a culture. One person creating safety creates a ripple. Others notice and join. Eventually, the culture shifts.

It starts with you choosing to eat last.

## The Commitment

Leadership requires sacrifice. The question is: are you willing to eat last?

### The Leader's Commitment {.principle-box}

- I will put the group before myself
- I will protect those in my care
- I will share credit and take responsibility
- I will create safety so others can contribute their best
- I will sacrifice my comfort for the good of the team

## The Choice Is Yours

Sinek ends where he began: with a choice. Will you be the kind of leader people follow because they want to? Or because they have to?
