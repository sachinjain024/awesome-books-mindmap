When leaders prioritize people over quarterly numbers, remarkable things happen. When they prioritize numbers over people, trust erodes and performance suffers. This chapter explores what it takes to lead with courage.

## The Courage to Sacrifice

True leadership requires sacrificing short-term gains for long-term health. This takes courage because the market often punishes such decisions.

### The Example of James Sinegal (Costco) {.story-box}

When Wall Street pressured Costco to cut employee wages and benefits, CEO James Sinegal refused. He maintained higher pay and better benefits than competitors, arguing that taking care of employees was the right thing to do.

The result: Lower turnover, higher productivity, better customer service, and long-term profitability that exceeded competitors.

## The Infinite Game

Leaders who prioritize people understand business as an infinite game—there's no final score, only the continuation of play.

### Infinite vs. Finite Mindset {.principle-box}

**Finite:** Win this quarter, beat the competition this year

**Infinite:** Build something that outlasts you, create enduring value

## The Cost of Putting Numbers First

### When Numbers Dominate {.warning-box}

- Layoffs to hit quarterly targets
- Cutting training and development
- Reducing quality to save costs
- Exploiting customers for short-term gain
- Sacrificing long-term health for immediate results

These decisions boost numbers temporarily but destroy the foundation of success: trust.

## Key Takeaways

- Courageous leaders prioritize people over quarterly numbers
- Business is an infinite game—play for continuation, not victory
- Taking care of people may hurt short-term metrics but builds long-term success
- Numbers-first decisions boost results temporarily but destroy trust
