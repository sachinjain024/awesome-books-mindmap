What is the role of a leader? Not to be the smartest or most dominant, but to protect the group. Alpha leaders in nature don't rule through power—they lead through sacrifice.

## The Alpha Misconception

We think "alpha" means dominant and aggressive. But in nature, alpha leaders are actually the most generous and protective members of the group.

### True Alpha Behavior {.concept-box}

- Eating last, not first
- Taking risks to protect the group
- Sharing resources
- Mediating conflicts
- Looking out for the vulnerable

Alpha leaders earn their position through service, not force.

## The Social Contract

There's an unspoken agreement between leaders and those they lead:

### The Leader's Side {.principle-box}

Leaders accept the responsibility to protect and serve. They sacrifice their own comfort and safety for the group.

### The Followers' Side {.principle-box}

In return, the group grants the leader authority and respect. They willingly follow and support the leader's vision.

When leaders violate this contract—taking care of themselves first—the group withdraws loyalty.

## Power vs. Authority

### Two Types of Leadership {.comparison-box}

**Power:**
- Comes from position
- Maintained through force
- People comply
- Breeds resentment
- Fragile—disappears with position

**Authority:**
- Comes from character
- Maintained through service
- People commit
- Inspires loyalty
- Endures beyond position

## Key Takeaways

- True alpha leaders protect and serve, not dominate
- There's a social contract: leaders sacrifice, followers support
- Power comes from position; authority from character
- When leaders break the contract, loyalty evaporates
