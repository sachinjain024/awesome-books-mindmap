When people become numbers, empathy disappears. Distance and abstraction make it easy to harm others without feeling it. This chapter explores the danger of losing the human in the data.

## The Problem of Abstraction

It's hard to feel empathy for "15% workforce reduction." It's impossible not to feel empathy when you know Sarah, who has two kids and just bought a house.

### How Abstraction Works {.concept-box}

The more abstract people become, the easier it is to harm them:

- "Headcount" → easier to cut than "people"
- "Resources" → easier to reallocate than "team members"
- "15% reduction" → easier than "layoff 150 employees"
- "Collateral damage" → easier than "killed civilians"

## The Distance Problem

Physical and emotional distance enables harmful decisions. Leaders who don't see the people affected can make callous choices.

### Distance Enables Harm {.warning-box}

- C-suite making cuts without meeting affected employees
- Managers sending layoff emails instead of meeting face-to-face
- Decisions made in boardrooms far from the shop floor
- Metrics and dashboards replacing human interaction

## The Solution: Proximity

The antidote to abstraction is proximity. Great leaders stay close to the people they serve.

### Maintaining Connection {.safety-box}

- Walk the floor regularly
- Know people's names and stories
- Make decisions face-to-face when possible
- See the human impact of every decision
- Use specific names, not general categories

## Key Takeaways

- Abstraction makes it easy to harm people without feeling it
- When people become numbers, empathy disappears
- Distance (physical and emotional) enables callous decisions
- The antidote is proximity—stay close to the people you serve
