Sinek addresses common objections to creating safety: "But what about performance?" "What about accountability?" "Won't people get complacent?" The answers reveal why safety actually enables higher performance.

## Objection 1: What About Performance?

The concern: If people feel too safe, won't they become lazy?

### The Reality {.concept-box}

Safety doesn't mean no expectations. It means people can focus on meeting those expectations instead of worrying about office politics or job security. High-performing teams have both high standards AND high safety.

## Objection 2: What About Accountability?

Safety doesn't eliminate accountability—it makes it possible. When people feel safe, they:

### Accountability in Safe Environments {.safety-box}

- Admit mistakes openly (instead of hiding them)
- Ask for help when struggling
- Hold each other accountable (peer pressure works)
- Take responsibility for outcomes

## Objection 3: Not Everyone Deserves Trust

True—some people abuse trust. But this reveals a selection and culture problem, not a reason to abandon trust.

### Building Trust {.principle-box}

Start with trust, verify through behavior. When someone violates trust, address it directly. But don't punish everyone for one person's failure by removing trust from the whole organization.

## Key Takeaways

- Safety and high standards aren't opposites—they enable each other
- Accountability works better when people feel safe to admit mistakes
- Trust isn't naive—it's the foundation for performance
- Address trust violations individually, don't punish everyone
