Abundance—whether of resources, success, or dopamine—can destroy cultures. This chapter explores how too much of a good thing creates addiction and undermines the behaviors that created success in the first place.

## The Danger of Abundance

When resources are scarce, we cooperate. When they're abundant, we become complacent and self-interested.

### The Abundance Paradox {.concept-box}

Success creates abundance. Abundance creates complacency. Complacency destroys the discipline that created success. This leads to decline—and the cycle repeats.

## Dopamine Addiction in Organizations

Organizations can become addicted to dopamine hits—quarterly results, deal closings, rapid growth. This addiction comes at the cost of long-term health.

### Signs of Dopamine Addiction {.warning-box}

- Short-term thinking dominates
- Constant pressure for "more"
- Celebration of individual achievement over teamwork
- Metrics obsession
- Exhaustion and burnout
- Loss of purpose beyond hitting numbers

## The Lost Generation

Sinek argues that modern work culture has created a generation addicted to dopamine (instant gratification, social media, quick wins) but starved of oxytocin (deep relationships, meaning, belonging).

### The Imbalance {.biology-box}

When dopamine dominates and oxytocin is scarce:

- Relationships feel superficial
- Achievement feels empty
- Anxiety and depression increase
- Loyalty disappears
- Nothing feels "enough"

## Key Takeaways

- Abundance can destroy the discipline that created success
- Organizations can become addicted to dopamine (short-term wins)
- Modern culture over-emphasizes dopamine, under-emphasizes oxytocin
- The result: achievement without satisfaction, connection without depth
