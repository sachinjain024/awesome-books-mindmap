## Understanding the Book

**Total: 6 Chapters | 12 Strategies | 4 Types of Integration**

**The Whole-Brain Child** bridges the gap between neuroscience and parenting. Drawing on the latest brain research, Siegel and Bryson explain how a child's brain is wired, how it matures, and how parents can turn everyday moments into opportunities to help the whole brain develop.

The central insight: **Integration is the key to mental health.** When the different parts of the brain work together-left with right, upstairs with downstairs-children thrive emotionally, intellectually, and socially.
