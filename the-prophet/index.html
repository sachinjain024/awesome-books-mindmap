            <h2>About This Mind Map</h2>
            <p>Almustafa has lived in the city of Orphalese for twelve years. As his ship arrives to take him home, the people ask him to speak on the great themes of life: love, marriage, children, giving, work, joy and sorrow, freedom, friendship, time, and more. Gibran's poetic answers have inspired readers for a century.</p>
