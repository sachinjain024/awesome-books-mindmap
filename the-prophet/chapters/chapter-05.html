        <h1 class="chapter-title">On Teaching, Friendship & Time</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">The Prophet</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Almustafa speaks on teaching—the teacher gives of faith and lovingness, not only wisdom—on friendship as the field of the soul, and on time as a single present moment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>On Teaching</h2>
            <p>The teacher does not give you his wisdom but his faith and his lovingness. If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind. The astronomer may speak of his understanding of space, but he cannot give you his understanding. Each person must find their own.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."
                <div class="attribution">— Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>On Friendship</h2>
            <p>Your friend is your needs answered. He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving. Let your best be for your friend. If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also. For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill? Seek him always with hours to live.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>On Time</h2>
            <p>Yesterday is but today's memory, and tomorrow is today's dream. The present moment holds all time. "And if you would measure time, do not measure it with the measure of the name of the year or the season. Let each season wrap the other, and let today embrace the past with remembrance and the future with longing."</p>
