        <div class="chapter-meta">The Prophet</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Almustafa speaks on giving, work, and the unity of joy and sorrow. Give as the river gives; work with love; and know that sorrow carves the cup that will hold your joy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>On Giving</h2>
            <p>You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give. The river gives and keeps giving; so give, for what you keep will decay. "See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver."</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Work is love made visible."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>On Work</h2>
            <p>Work with love. If you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better to leave your work and sit at the gate and take alms. For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man's hunger. To work with love is to weave cloth with threads drawn from your heart.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>On Joy and Sorrow</h2>
            <p>Joy and sorrow are inseparable. The same well from which your laughter rises was often filled with your tears. The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain. When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find that which has given you sorrow is giving you joy.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Sorrow is not the opposite of joy—it is the carving that makes room for joy. Accept both; they are the same river.</p>
