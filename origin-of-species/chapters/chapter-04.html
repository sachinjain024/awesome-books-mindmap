        <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4: Natural Selection</h1>
        <div class="chapter-meta">Part I: Variation & Selection</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>This is the heart of Darwin's theory—the mechanism that transforms the raw material of variation into the intricate adaptations of life. Natural selection is the "invisible hand" of evolution, selecting among variants without intention or foresight, yet producing results that appear designed. Darwin also introduces two crucial concepts: sexual selection and the divergence of character.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Logic of Natural Selection</h2>
            <p>Darwin's argument follows an elegant logical structure:</p>

            <div class="argument-box">
                <h4>The Syllogism of Natural Selection</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Variation exists</strong> — individuals differ in countless ways (Chapter 1-2)</li>
                    <li><strong>Inheritance occurs</strong> — offspring resemble parents (Chapter 1)</li>
                    <li><strong>Overproduction happens</strong> — more are born than can survive (Chapter 3)</li>
                    <li><strong>Therefore:</strong> Individuals with advantageous variations survive and reproduce more</li>
                    <li><strong>Therefore:</strong> Those advantageous variations accumulate over generations</li>
                    <li><strong>Therefore:</strong> Species change over time—they evolve</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>The logic is almost mathematical in its inevitability. Given the premises—which Darwin has established empirically—the conclusion follows necessarily.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Can it, then, be thought improbable... that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life, should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations? If such do occur, can we doubt... that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind?"
                <div class="attribution">— Charles Darwin</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Natural Selection Defined</h2>
            <p>Darwin carefully defines what he means by natural selection:</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <h4>Natural Selection</h4>
                <p>The preservation of favorable variations and the rejection of injurious variations. It operates automatically and inevitably wherever there is heritable variation and a struggle for existence. It has no intention, foresight, or design—yet produces adaptations that appear purposeful.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Darwin frequently uses the metaphor of nature as a "breeder," but he emphasizes the differences: nature can act on internal as well as external characters; nature scrutinizes every variation in every part of every organism; nature works over geological timescales; and nature has no goal or ideal in mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Sexual Selection</h2>
            <p>Darwin identifies a special form of selection that depends not on survival but on mating success:</p>

            <div class="definition-box">
                <h4>Sexual Selection</h4>
                <p>Selection based on advantages in competition for mates. Males may compete directly (antlers, tusks, strength) or may be chosen by females based on display features (plumage, songs, ornaments).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Examples of Sexual Selection</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Peacock's tail</strong> — costly ornament that attracts females</li>
                    <li><strong>Stag's antlers</strong> — weapons for male-male combat</li>
                    <li><strong>Birdsong</strong> — attracts mates and deters rivals</li>
                    <li><strong>Bright colors in male birds</strong> — often far more vivid than in females</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Sexual selection can produce traits that actually harm survival—like the peacock's cumbersome tail—because the mating advantage outweighs the survival cost. This explains many puzzling features that don't fit the usual "survival of the fittest" narrative.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Illustrations of Natural Selection</h2>
            <p>Darwin provides thought experiments to illustrate how natural selection might work:</p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>The Wolf Example</h4>
                <p>Suppose deer become scarcer. Wolves that are slightly faster would catch more prey and leave more offspring. Over generations, the wolf population would become faster. Meanwhile, if prey became more cunning, selection would favor smarter wolves. Different prey in different areas could lead to the divergence of wolf varieties.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>The Flower and Bee</h4>
                <p>A plant that produces slightly more nectar attracts more bees and gets better pollinated. But a plant with nectar too deep for most bees might benefit from attracting only specific pollinators. Over time, flowers and their pollinators can become exquisitely co-adapted.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Divergence of Character</h2>
            <p>Darwin's principle of divergence is often overlooked but is crucial to his theory. Why do species diversify rather than simply becoming "more fit" along a single dimension?</p>

            <div class="argument-box">
                <h4>Why Divergence Is Favored</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Competition is fiercest among similar forms (Chapter 3)</li>
                    <li>Any variant that can exploit a different niche escapes this competition</li>
                    <li>More divergent forms can coexist in the same area</li>
                    <li>Therefore, natural selection favors <em>divergence</em> from ancestral types</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>This principle explains why a single ancestral form can give rise to many different descendants—why the tree of life branches rather than forming a single line of improvement.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>The Tree of Life</h4>
                <p>Darwin's famous diagram in this chapter shows branching descent: from a single ancestral species, multiple lines diverge, some going extinct, others continuing to branch. Over time, the slight differences that distinguish varieties become the larger differences that distinguish species, genera, families, and higher taxa.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Extinction</h2>
            <p>The flipside of natural selection is extinction. As new forms arise and compete, less well-adapted forms are eliminated.</p>

            <div class="observation-box">
                <h4>Extinction as Inevitable</h4>
                <p>Extinction is not an anomaly or catastrophe—it's the natural consequence of competition and change. The fossil record shows that most species that ever lived are now extinct. New forms don't just add to diversity; they often replace older forms.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Darwin notes that extinction tends to eliminate intermediate forms, leaving gaps between surviving species. This explains why species often appear distinct rather than grading into one another—the intermediates have been out-competed and eliminated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>On the Degree of Advancement</h2>
            <p>Is evolution progress? Darwin is cautious here. Natural selection adapts organisms to their local conditions—it doesn't necessarily make them "higher" or "better" in any absolute sense.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does not necessarily include progressive development—it only takes advantage of such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under its complex relations of life."
                <div class="attribution">— Charles Darwin</div>
            </div>

            <p>A parasite that loses its eyes and digestive system is beautifully adapted to its way of life—is it more or less "advanced" than its free-living ancestor? The question has no clear answer. Evolution is about adaptation, not progress.</p>
        </div>
