        <div class="chapter-meta">Practice One</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Time is the scarcest resource. Unlike money or people, you can't rent, hire, or buy more of it. Effective executives start not with tasks but with time—they know where their time goes, and they manage it systematically.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Time Is the Limiting Factor</h2>
            <p>Everything requires time. And time is totally irreplaceable. You can substitute other resources, but not time.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Time is the scarcest resource, and unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed."
                <div class="attribution">— Peter Drucker</div>
            </div>

            <p>Most people are poor judges of their own time usage. What they think they do and what they actually do rarely match.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Three-Step Process</h2>
            <p>Drucker prescribes a three-step process for managing time:</p>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Step 1: Record Time</h4>
                <p>Track how you actually spend your time—not how you think you spend it. Keep a log for several weeks. Most people are shocked by the results.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Step 2: Manage Time</h4>
                <p>Analyze the log and cut out time-wasters. Ask of every activity: "What would happen if this were not done at all?" If the answer is "nothing," stop doing it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-box">
                <h4>Step 3: Consolidate Time</h4>
                <p>Block remaining discretionary time into large, continuous chunks. Effective work requires concentrated time—not fragments scattered throughout the day.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Time-Wasters to Eliminate</h2>
            <p>Drucker identifies common time-wasters that can be eliminated or reduced:</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Systemic Time-Wasters</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recurrent crises:</strong> If the same crisis happens repeatedly, it's a system failure—fix the system</li>
                    <li><strong>Overstaffing:</strong> Too many people spend time coordinating rather than working</li>
                    <li><strong>Malorganization:</strong> Too many meetings signal poor organizational design</li>
                    <li><strong>Information malfunction:</strong> Information not reaching the right people</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Diagnostic Questions</h2>
            <p>For each activity in your time log, ask:</p>

            <div class="question-box">
                <h4>Time Audit Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>"What would happen if this were not done at all?" (If nothing, eliminate it)</li>
                    <li>"Which of these activities could be done by someone else just as well?" (Delegate)</li>
                    <li>"What do I do that wastes your time?" (Ask your subordinates)</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Consolidating Discretionary Time</h2>
            <p>After eliminating waste, consolidate what remains. Important work requires concentrated time.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>The Power of Blocks</h4>
                <p>Writing a report takes 6-8 concentrated hours. But those hours must be continuous—not 15 minutes here and 30 there. Effective executives protect blocks of time and fight fragmentation.</p>
            </div>

                <li>Time is the scarcest resource and cannot be replaced</li>
