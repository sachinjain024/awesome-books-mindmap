        <div class="chapter-meta">Building Momentum</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>This concluding chapter connects the Good to Great research with Collins' earlier work, Built to Last. Good to Great answers the question of how to become great; Built to Last answers how to sustain greatness over generations. Together, they provide a roadmap from mediocrity to enduring excellence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Relationship Between the Two Books</h2>
            <p>Good to Great and Built to Last are complementary works that together form a more complete picture. Good to Great is about the transition from mediocrity to excellence. Built to Last is about sustaining excellence once you achieve it.</p>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>Two Phases of Greatness</h4>
                <p style="text-align: center; margin: 1rem 0;">
                    <strong>Good to Great</strong><br>
                    Making the leap from good performance to great performance<br><br>
                    ↓<br><br>
                    <strong>Built to Last</strong><br>
                    Sustaining great performance and building an enduring company
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Think of Good to Great as the prequel to Built to Last. First you must become great; then you work on enduring.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Core Ideology: The Key to Endurance</h2>
            <p>Built to Last discovered that enduring great companies have a core ideology—core values and core purpose—that remains fixed while their strategies and practices adapt to a changing world. This is the "preserve the core / stimulate progress" dynamic.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Preserve the Core / Stimulate Progress</h4>
                <p><strong>Preserve the Core:</strong> Core values and purpose remain constant. These are the timeless, enduring principles that guide the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Stimulate Progress:</strong> Everything else—strategies, practices, structures, systems—can and must change in response to the changing world.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The good-to-great concepts provide the foundation upon which to build endurance. But to last, companies must discover their core ideology and maintain it even as they adapt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs)</h2>
            <p>Built to Last introduced the concept of BHAGs—ambitious goals that energize and focus an organization. Good-to-great companies used BHAGs, but their BHAGs emerged from understanding (the Hedgehog Concept), not bravado.</p>

            <div class="comparison-box">

                            <li>Set with blind hope</li>
                            <li>Ignore brutal facts</li>

            <h2>The Integrated Framework</h2>
            <p>Collins presents the complete framework for going from good to great to built to last. The good-to-great concepts stack upon each other, and the built-to-last concepts provide the capstone for endurance.</p>

            <div class="case-study">

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Greatness?</h2>
            <p>The research team wrestled with a fundamental question: Does it matter? Is building a great company worth the effort? Collins concludes that it does matter—not just for financial returns, but for the meaning and fulfillment of human work.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The point is not that we should 'add' meaning to our work but, rather, that we should do work that is already inherently meaningful. The builders of greatness were satisfied with nothing less."
                <div class="attribution">— Jim Collins</div>
            </div>

            <p>The good-to-great companies didn't achieve greatness for the sake of fame or fortune—many of their leaders shunned both. They achieved greatness because of an inner drive toward excellence, toward meaning, toward making a contribution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>It's Not About the Money</h2>
            <p>While good-to-great companies generated tremendous financial returns, the research found that money was rarely the primary motivation. Great companies see profit as necessary—like oxygen for a living organism—but not the purpose of existence.</p>

            <div class="principle-box">
                <h4>Profit as Oxygen</h4>
                <p>Profit is essential—you can't survive without it. But no great company's primary purpose is to generate profit. Purpose transcends mere money-making:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fannie Mae: Democratizing home ownership</li>
                    <li>Abbott: Contributing to cost-effective healthcare</li>
                    <li>Nucor: Proving American manufacturing can compete</li>
                    <li>Gillette: Building great consumer brands</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Journey Continues</h2>
            <p>Collins concludes with an important observation: the research is never truly finished. The good-to-great journey is ongoing for any organization that aspires to greatness. The concepts are tools, not guarantees.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice and discipline."
                <div class="attribution">— Jim Collins</div>
            </div>

            <p>The path from good to great to built to last is available to any organization—business, social sector, or individual—willing to embrace these principles with rigor and discipline over sustained time.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Good to Great answers how to become great; Built to Last answers how to sustain it</li>
                <li>Core ideology (values + purpose) provides the foundation for endurance</li>
                <li>"Preserve the core / stimulate progress"—keep what's essential while adapting everything else</li>
                <li>BHAGs should emerge from Hedgehog understanding, not bravado</li>
                <li>Profit is necessary (like oxygen) but not the purpose of a great company</li>
                <li>Greatness is not a function of circumstance—it's a matter of conscious choice and discipline</li>
