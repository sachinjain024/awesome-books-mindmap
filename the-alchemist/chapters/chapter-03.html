        <div class="chapter-meta">The Journey</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Robbed in Tangier, Santiago is forced to work for a crystal merchant. In this detour he learns about omens, the fear of failure, and the choice between security and the call of his Personal Legend.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Tangier and the Theft</h2>
            <p>Santiago's money is stolen soon after he arrives in Africa. He is alone in a foreign land with nothing. In his despair he considers going home—but he has nothing to return to. The setback forces him to find another way forward.</p>

                "There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Crystal Merchant</h2>
            <p>Santiago finds work in a crystal shop. The merchant has never made the pilgrimage to Mecca—he keeps his dream as a hope for the future rather than a journey to take now. Santiago sees in him the danger of postponing one's Personal Legend.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>Some people prefer to dream about their legend rather than pursue it. The thought of failure can feel safer than the risk of trying—but that safety is an illusion that leaves the heart unfulfilled.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Reading Omens and Moving On</h2>
            <p>By suggesting new ideas—like displaying tea in crystal—Santiago helps the shop thrive. He saves money and learns to read omens in daily events. When the time is right, he joins a caravan heading into the desert, back on the path to his treasure.</p>
