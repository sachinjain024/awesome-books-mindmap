        <div class="chapter-meta">The Journey</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Crossing the desert with the caravan, Santiago reaches an oasis where he meets Fatima—the woman of the desert—and the Alchemist, who teaches him to listen to his heart and to see that the Soul of the World speaks through love and omens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Oasis and Fatima</h2>
            <p>At the oasis, Santiago falls in love with Fatima. He fears that staying with her means abandoning his Personal Legend. She tells him that the desert takes men away but that she will wait for him. True love does not hold the other back from their destiny.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "I'm a woman of the desert... I want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes."

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Alchemist</h2>
            <p>The Alchemist appears as a figure of wisdom and power. He teaches Santiago that the heart knows the language of the Soul of the World, that love is never a reason to stop pursuing your legend, and that "lead" can become "gold"—meaning we can transform our inner state through intention and courage.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Insight</h4>
                <p>The real alchemy is not turning metal into gold; it is transforming the lead of fear and doubt into the gold of courage and purpose. That happens when we listen to our heart and follow omens.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Listening to the Heart</h2>
            <p>Santiago learns that the heart can be treacherous because it speaks of fear of loss—but it also holds our deepest dreams. The Alchemist teaches him to listen without letting fear make his decisions. With that clarity, Santiago continues toward the pyramids.</p>
